# Packing Tips

## Gear

 **I carry a Farpoint 40L Travel Backpack plus a large purse.**
 * The backpack is large enough for a week's worth of clothes, but small enough to be taken as a carry-on on *most* airlines.
 * The backpack has a padded hip belt and straps, allowing me to walk a few miles with it. the straps zip away flat, turning it into a duffle bag for carrying onto a plane or train.
 * My purse is *almost* tote-bag sized. This is because I use it to carry my laptop and charger along with my normal purse contents. It has a top zipper, important when putting it beneath an airplane seat, lest your stuff roll away.

## Packing
* I underpack on purpose. 
* I prioritize things that are difficult or expensive to buy. Usually that means a couple pairs of pants that fit my short legs, a packable coat and a packable raincoat, a wool sweater, and a few well-fitting bras. On top of that, I throw in some socks, underwear, shirts, and one non-wrinkling dress nice enough for dinner out, and a pair of flats. Plus my toiletry kit and a first aid kit.
* There are two keys to traveling light:
	* Plan to do laundry.
	* Plan to buy a few items while you travel.
* Liquids are a problem when you want to carry your bag on a plane. I limit myself to a mini toothpaste, a mini hand sanitizer, and my favorite face lotion. Everything else I buy after we land.
