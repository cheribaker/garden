**It pisses me off when corporations data mine my life.** Like most people, I find online annoying, but my main objection isn't the ads themselves, but the way tech companies track and profile ordinary people as they go about their lives. Use a credit card and your purchasing habits can be sold. Use a mainstream email provider and your messages to friends and family can be scanned for the purposes of profiling you. Do a simple web search and your private curiosities can be used in court to build a case against you should you be in the wrong place and the wrong time, snagged by a geofence warrant.

I'm not a software engineer (although I'm married to one) so there are limits to how much I can protect myself via extraordinary means. Nor do I want to go off the grid and live in a cabin like Ron Swanson, shooting down drones with a pump action rifle.

Okay... I *kind of want to do that.*  üòè

Like most people, my ability to completely break free from corporate surveillance is limited by the work I do. I sell my books on large platforms, including places like Google Play. I cannot sell there without having a Gmail account, and I cannot have a Gmail account, thus I am roped into Terms of Service that I would prefer to avoid. This is one example out of hundreds.

There are no perfect solutions. Thus I'm left with three things I can do:

1) Asking government reps & agencies to put better regulations in place (with low expectation of success)
2) Use alternatives, where alternatives exist and I can afford to use them
3) Accept the things I cannot change
