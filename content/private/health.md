This page is my reference for health and fitness.

### Status

I started a health improvement program on 5/1/23

### Reference Material

The following information guided my thinking:

[An Evidence-Based Approach to Goal Setting and Behavior Change](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/goal-setting/)

[The Best Fat Loss Article onthe Motherfuckin' Internet](https://physiqonomics.com/fat-loss/)

[The Fitness Wiki](https://thefitness.wiki/)

[The Value of Post-Diet Maintanence](https://rpstrength.com/expert-advice/the-value-of-post-diet-maintenance)

And I'm using the following tools:

[nSun's Adaptive TDEE Calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QTWDxFaB0r-7U6vZmG1s8of7jwd2GHHi/edit#gid=770164572)
The LoseIt App in the iOS App Store for food tracking


### Notes

5/1/23 - Weighed and measured myself, but as the advice goes, I "kept it unemotional."

Set up the TDEE spreadsheet, starting calories and macros. Will walk most days this week and track my food and weight.
