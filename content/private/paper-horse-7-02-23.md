I didn't write yesterday. No biggie, some days the next chapter doesn't feel quite *ready* yet in my mind and it's best to focus on something else for a bit. Hence the reason why Nanowrimo rarely works as well for me as I'd expect.

Today, we did the usual. Woke up, stretched, took a walk to find some coffee. While I was sitting there, caffeine loading, I noticed that thinking about my day in context of "words I must do" sounded utterly dull and uninteresting. What a mistake that would be, turning what should be a fun thing into the day's checkbox.

As soon as I thought: *Ha. This is so stupid. I don't care about that number at all!* my boredom cleared and I was free to think about what interested me, namely, writing the chapter in which a murder mystery party happens aboard a cruise ship.

It's fine that I tried to do a little nano this month. Heck, I even found it motivating for 72 hours! Yet I suppose this is a lesson I needed to learn yet again. My old "business thinking" isn't so useful in the arts. In the corporate world, we whip ourselves around, making charts, building complex structures to feel important about our tasks, giving ourselves the gold stars for being obedient.

Writing doesn't work that way for me. Never has, really. The gold star is the work itself and anything else is... an old reflex?

Let's call it that. An echo of the kind of work I was happy to leave behind.
