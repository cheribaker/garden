A running list of things I know now, that I wish I'd known when I started self publishing. It's possible that some of the things I "know" are wrong, or will be wrong in the future. :) But I'll try to keep this up to date.


## Income = Earnings - Expenses

*I knew this formula, but I engaged in wishful thinking anyway.*

I spent WAY too much money on my first few books. Custom book covers, multiple rounds of editing, courses, conferences, and so on. We authors feel proud of our work and want to put our best foot forward. We're also concerned about appearing amateurish. Yet if you want self-publishing to be a business and not a hobby, you'll need to spend less than you make.

Since then, I've met many other authors who spend WAY too much money on their first few books. I've learned not to give the advice of keeping a low overhead, because the answer is inevitably..  YES, BUT....

This mistake seems to be a stage of growth that we all need to pass through, leaving a hole the size of a large truck in our bank accounts.

As I've said, we writers are very proud. Very afraid of putting out less than the best. And we wrap our beginner books in fine clothing because it makes us feel less afraid.

This isn't me being judgy. I've been there!

### Alternatives

Does editing cost $800 you don't have? Well, join a writers group to exchange edits with friends. Print out your book and read it aloud word-by-word to catch those annoying typos. You will not go to hell for DIY'ing your book.

Start with a premade cover. Maybe it's not your DREAM cover, but you can likely find one that is appropriate and attractive without exploding your bank account.

As a self published author, you're not working in the same world that traditionally published authors work in. For them, making a big splash up front and selling enough copies right away to earn another contract is essential. But us? We self published authors are the scrappy, evolving, chameleon-folk of the book world. We have time and flexibility. We work for ourselves and no one can take our career away.

No one can say... "Sorry. You can't write any more books! You had your chance and you blew it!"

**Real Talk**

- Your first books are not likely to be bestsellers.
- Even if they are, bestsellers aren't made via expensive covers and editing. They're made through a writer's talents blended into the fickle zeitgeist of reader taste, plus word of mouth and viral factors beyond your control.
- If you publish your first few books inexpensively, you've got a **LOW OVERHEAD** and over time that means it can start giving you income.
- You can write for a while, publish frugally, and after your book has earned you a little money, use that money to upgrade your covers. This is a great way to do it!

Say it with me, now. Money should flow *toward* the writer!

*Please please please* don't spend thousands of dollars on your first book unless you have thousands of dollars to blow with zero consequences to your financial security.

I can already hear people saying..... YES, BUT.... ðŸ˜‚

Well, I did what I could.
