# How I'm Studying Spanish

## Phase One: Dabbling

I dabbled in Spanish before I began learning in earnest. Here are some of the things I did:

- Using Duolingo for a few weeks at a time.
- Buying "How to Speak Spanish" CDs and listening to them.
- Traveling as a tourist in Spain and South America with a phrase book.

My linguistic faffing around was fine for getting around as a tourist, ordering meals, and making sense of public transportation. 

## Phase Two: Classes

In 2021, we went to Spain and enrolled in a Spanish immersion school for two months. While it was a great experience and it kickstarted my language skills, not everyone can pick up their life and do this. Still, I believe **attending regular classes** was what finally transitioned me from "dabbler" to learner.

What I learned about learning:

* Language learning isn't *one* skill. It's several. Reading, Listening, and Speaking each progress at their own pace.
* Hours spent in your new language matters. Taking a class for 30 minutes three times a week and never thinking about Spanish between classes is going to be a *very slow* way to learn the language.
* You must retrain your brain to hear different sounds. At first, you may believe you are pronouncing everything correctly because what comes out of your mouth matches what you *heard*. Yet we often don't hear the nuances of pronunciation well at the start. Thus you need lots of practice speaking and listening, not just tapping answers on your smartphone.
* Actually using the language is the fun part! Meeting new people and conversing is the reward of learning a new language. So while speaking a new language as a beginner is scary (and you will often be wrong) you need to put yourself in situations where you'll use it.

Classes are great because you practice *all* the skills while meeting other people to talk to. If you're tired of dabbling and want to learn in earnest, my advice is this: Enroll in a class!

## Phase Three: Building a Base of Spanish

Even after two months of immersion, I'm still learning grammar and vocabulary. Just like a long-distance runner needs to gradually build up a base of fitness before running a marathon, a new language learner needs to build up a base of knowledge. Once you know a few hundred common verbs, a thousand common nouns, and basic conjugations for three or four tenses, you'll feel that you've made a big leap forward. But how do you learn those things? Gradually, by studying and incorporating Spanish into your daily life.

Here's how I'm building my base. (I've not been as consistent as I'd like.)

1. Vocabulary

I review at least 20 Spanish words per day. I'm too lazy to manually make flashcards or an Anki deck, so I use the SpanishDict app, focusing on common words and verbs. The app *says* the words so I focus on pronunciation at the same time I'm memorizing new words.

2. Conjugation

I pick a tense (present, simple future, etc) and run drills using that tense with common verbs. Again, I use the SpanishDict app for this. It seems to work better to practice one tense at a time.

3. Listening

I listen to the Language Transfer podcast, trying to go through at least one episode per day. It's pretty damn fabulous.  There are many good [Youtube](/notes/spanish-learning-resources.md) channels too.

Also, P & I pick a Netflix show and watch it in Spanish, usually with subtitles on. If the subtitles match the sound, we listen and read in Spanish. If the subtitles don't match, we listen in Spanish and read in English.

4. Reading

Every day, I read some Spanish. I have a collection of Spanish subreddits I skim through. A few times per week, I read a few pages of a fiction book in Spanish, making liberal use of my iPad's translate feature to help me get through sentences I don't understand. For me, reading and speaking are highly coorelated. I grasp a lot of grammar and rhythm by reading, more so than by listening.

5. Speaking

We found a Spanish meetup and we've been to a few sessions. It's great, and we should go more often! Also, P & I speak Spanish around the house.

## Putting It All Together

This may sound like I'm studying *super hard* and putting in *maximum effort.* Honestly though, it's not that intense. My vocab and conjugation drills take about forty minutes on my phone and I do them either in the morning while I drink coffee or in bed before I fall asleep. I'm already watching some TV, so why not watch some in Spanish? I'm already reading books, so why not read a little in Spanish? Ditto for Reddit, and chatting with my spouse, and so on. I enjoy memes, so I subscribed to the "Spanish Memes" subreddit. Memes are surprisingly fun in a foreign language because many include puns and double meanings. By shifting some of your current habits and interests into your new language, the new language fits right into your day.

**The Hard Part**

In my opinion, learning a new language is a big undertaking! To get from "knowing nothing" to "knowing enough to watch TV and speak to strangers" is a huge amount of work. Again, we're talking about learning a few thousand nouns, several hundred common verbs, four or five tenses, pronunciation, and sentence structure. When people say "Oh, Spanish is easy" I think it does a disservice to those who don't find learning languages easy. For me, it's never been easy, but it has been *fun*. The hard part is getting through that initial mountain of learning.

When you open an article in Spanish and you understand only a handful of words, you may as well be reading gibberish. Yet if you keep adding to your base of Spanish, eventually you'll recognize more. 

"Oh. That's a past tense ending."
"Hmm. I understand part of that sentence..."
"I keep seeing that word! I should look it up."

It's tough to feel like you're making progress when you slog through a sentence word by word. Yet if you keep up with your studying, eventually you'll understand a quarter of the words. Then half! In time, I hope to reach the point where I understand 80% of what I hear or read, and then I can begin filling in the smaller gaps.

**Little Wins**

For me, the fun part comes when I surprise myself by understanding something as it's said. When we were in Spain taking our classes P and I were walking down the street. I heard a woman talking on her phone.

Has comido algo?

Have you eaten something?

My brain heard the meaning, not the language, and it wasn't until I'd walked further down the street that I realized I'd simply comprehended Spanish without translating it. I had a similar moment the next week, when I was thinking about chancletas. Had I brought my chancletas on the trip? A few moments later, I realized I was thinking about flip-flops only my brain had chosen the Spanish word.
