# How I'm Studying Spanish

## Phase One: Dabbling

I dabbled in Spanish before I began learning in earnest. Here are some of the things I did:

- Using Duolingo for a few weeks at a time.
- Buying "How to Speak Spanish" CDs and listening to them.
- Traveling as a tourist in Spain and South America with a phrase book.

My dabbling was sufficient for getting around as a tourist, ordering meals, and making sense of public transportation. Yet I didn't really "speak" Spanish and I understood very little of what was happening around me.

## Phase Two: Classes

In 2021 I went to Spain and enrolled in a Spanish immersion school for two months. While it was a great experience and it kickstarted my language skills, it's not something everyone can pick up and do.

Still, I believe attending regular classes was the thing that finally transitioned me from "dabbler" to learner, and thus I think it's a great idea to enroll in a class.

What I learned about learning:

* Language learning isn't *one* skill. It's several. Reading, Listening, and Speaking each progress at their own pace.
* Hours in your new language matters. Taking a class for 30 minutes three times a week and never thinking about Spanish between classes is going to be a *very slow* way to learn the language.
* You must retrain your brain to hear different sounds. At first, you may believe you are pronouncing everything correctly because what comes out of your mouth matches what you *heard*. Yet we often don't hear the nuances of pronunciation well at the start. Thus you need lots of practice speaking and listening, not just tapping answers on your smartphone.
* Actually using the language is the fun part! Meeting new people and conversing is the fun part. So while speaking a new language as a beginner is scary (and you will often be wrong) you need to put yourself in positions to use your new language.

Classes are great because you practice all the skills, and you meet other people to talk to.

## Phase Three: Building a Base of Spanish

Even after two months of immersion, I'm still wrapping my head around grammar and vocabulary. Much like a long-distance runner needs to gradually build up a base of fitness before running a marathon, a new language learner needs to build up a base of knowledge. Once you know a few hundred common verbs, a thousand common nouns, and basic conjugations for three or four tenses, you'll feel that you've made a big leap forward! But how do you learn those things? Gradually, by studying and incorporating Spanish into your daily life.

Here's how I'm building my base. (I've not been consistent, so I'm working on it.)

1. Vocabulary

I review at least 20 Spanish words per day. I'm too lazy to manually make flashcards or an Anki deck, so I use the SpanishDict app, focusing on common words and verbs. The app *says* the words, so I pay attention to the pronunciation at the same time I'm learning the words.

2. Conjugation

I pick a tense (present, simple future, etc) and run drills using that tense with common verbs. Again, I use the SpanishDict app for this. It seems to work better to practice one tense at a time instead of mixing them.

3. Listening

I listen to the Language Transfer podcast, trying to go through at least one episode per day. 

P & I pick a Netflix show in Spanish and watch it with Spanish subtitles on.

4. Reading

Every day, I read some Spanish. I have a collection of Spanish subreddits I skim through. Sometimes I'll pull up a Spanish newspaper and try to read an article. A few times per week, I read a few pages of a fiction book in Spanish, making liberal use of my iPad's translate feature to help me get through sentences I don't understand.

5. Speaking

We found a Spanish meetup and we've been to a few sessions. It's great, and we should go more often!
