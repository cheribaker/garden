I released my first novel in 2014, and from the very beginning I wanted to self publish. Here, in 
2023, we've finally reached a point where self-publishing is no longer viewed as 'second best' or 'what writers do when they can't find an agent' but it's been a slow process to get here.

Most people who self-publish do so because they prefer certain things:

- Higher royalty % on each book sold.
- Personal control over
	- What you write
	- When you publish
	- Where you publish
	- What you charge
	- Design (Covers, fonts, etc)

Money and control are the two biggest advantages to self publishing, but for most of us, control casts the final vote. Traditional publishers fill their catalog slots very selectively (as they should!) and this means an author who is passionate about *their* story may not find a compatible place to publish that work traditionally. With self publishing it's simple. You publish without barriers! As always, there is no guarantee of success.

Self publishers and Traditional publishers have that in common.

While I'm swayed by the "money and control" arguments for sure, there's actually a different reason  that drives me to self publish. Let's call it craftsmanship. You might know someone who is passionate about a hobby.
