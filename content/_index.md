## Welcome 

Hello, I’m Cheri and you've found my wiki, Literary Monster. This site is a semi-organized heap of my public notes, bookmarks, and projects-in process. Feel free to poke around!

I'm on <a rel="me" href="https://writing.exchange/@cheribaker">Mastodon</a>, if you'd like to say hello.

If you enjoyed your visit and you're motivated to give something back, you can [buy one of my books](http://www.cheribaker.com) for yourself or a friend.
