## Welcome 

Hello, I’m Cheri and you've found my wiki, Literary Monster. This site is a semi-organized heap of my public notes, bookmarks, and projects-in process. Feel free to poke around!

I'm on <a rel="me" href="https://writing.exchange/@cheribaker">Mastodon</a>, if you'd like to say hello. If you'd like a peek at the (unglamorous) life of a working author, I track my writing progress [here](/notes/progress).

If you enjoyed your visit and you're motivated to give something back, you can [buy one of my books](http://www.cheribaker.com) for yourself or a friend.

### Thought of the Day

> “The useless days will add up to something. The shitty waitressing jobs. The hours writing in your journal. The long meandering walks. The hours reading poetry and story collections and novels…. These things are your becoming.”
