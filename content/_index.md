## Welcome 

Hello, I’m [Cheri](https://cheri.omg.lol) and you've found my wiki, Literary Monster. This site is a semi-organized heap of my public notes, bookmarks, and projects-in process. Feel free to poke around!

If you enjoyed your visit and you want to give something back, you can [buy one of my books](http://www.cheribaker.com) for yourself or a friend.
