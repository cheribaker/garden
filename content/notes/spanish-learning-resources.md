Here are some of my favorite resources for learning Spanish:

1. [SpanishDict](https://www.spanishdict.com/) ($60/yr)

	I use the app for learning vocabulary, pronunciation, translation, and verb conjugation practice. 

2. [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com) (free)

	You can't learn to speak Spanish without *speaking* Spanish.  So go speak some Spanish even though you suck at it. 

3. [Language Transfer](https://www.languagetransfer.org/) (free)

	An excellent podcast to help you *think* in Spanish.

4. [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com)

	Netflix has tons of Spanish-language television shows, plus extensive subtitling and dubbing options for their original programming.

	Suggested shows: *TBD*

5. [YouTube](https//www.youtube.com)

	Likewise, YouTube has tons of language learning resources.

	Suggested channels: *TBD*
