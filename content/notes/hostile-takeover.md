>After the brutal attack that nearly killed her, Jessica returned to the Duke Agency to embark on a desperate mission. Now that she understands the true aims of her employer, she's determined to free the assistants from her family's dangerous grasp. In presenting herself as an ally to her aunt and uncles, she hopes to find a way to destroy the red files used to keep every assistant in line.

She'd been prepared for cruelty, even violence. What she hadn't  imagined was their kindness and generosity. For the first time in her life,  has she found the place where she belongs? As she struggles to do what she believes is right, and as she grapples with the troubling legacy left by her mother, aunt, and grandmother, Jessica has to wonder...
