*This post contains general spoilers for where Ellie’s story arc left off at the end of The Case of the Fond Farewell*

Apparently my brain eager to get going on the new book because she woke me up at 4:30am raring to go.  

🥱 I am *tired* but I've learned it's best to give creative brain what she wants. So here I am, awake obscenely early, jotting down my thoughts about getting started.

The Case of the Paper Horse will be the seventh book in the Ellie Tappet Mysteries, and I ended book six on a quintessential happy ending. I’m not going to blow up Ellie’s happy ending. She earned it and it’s hers! But this new book does feel different in that 1-6 comprised the story arc of Ellie finding happiness and now I’m in more of a one-off ‘mystery of the week’ scenario.

This morning is about putting myself back into Ellie’s shoes. A like to start a cozy mystery with an “itchy status quo” where my sleuth has something personal bugging them - the essence of whatever their “personal thing to overcome” will be. In this case it’s easy. Ellie has a new job aboard the ship. She’s the new boss, and she’s not very boss-like, so that's bound to be stressful.

Also, she's back from her honeymoon and living with Ben for the first time. I don’t anticipate a ton of friction there, but that could also be an adjustment for her.

At the start of a mystery I like to take the “itchy status quo” and slam it headfirst into some new situation. In this case, it will be planning a “murder mystery cruise” during a transatlantic repositioning voyage. And to make things extra stressful for poor Ellie I’ll be inviting a formidable travel writer from a famous magazine on board to watch her every move. But that's all setup:

* A new job.
* A new itinerary.
* Being the boss for the first time.
* LOTS of pressure!

PLUS the new situation

The *Adventurous Spirit* is headed to Spain.

and…

They’re planning a murder mystery cruise.

The "new situation stuff" is just fun and tropes. Cozies are supposed to be fun! I’ve always wanted to take a repositioning cruise and a murder mystery party on board feels amusingly meta. Also, I love Spain, and I want to leave the door open for the next book to take place in Valencia. So that’s where the ship is headed.

## Is this Pantsing?

I'm a happier writer since leaving structured outlines behind. But I’ve had about a year to think about this book, and that's been enough time to jot down some general ideas about the setup, the crime, and whodunnit and why. None of that is set in stone, but I like to have a set of ideas to work with.

Still, there’s nothing so intimidating as starting the day’s work with a blank-ass page, so last night I grabbed a notebook and jotted down bullet points for the first couple scenes.

So this is my work for day one. Get the kettle boiling. Establish the itchy status quo. Smash it into a fun premise. Settle behind Ellie’s eyes and see it play out as she would.

**Oh, and try not to freak out and overthink things.**
