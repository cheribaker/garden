I'm getting ready to write Ellie Tappet Book #7. I know what the story is about, and what the crime is about, and I need to do a bit more prep (character names, story notes) to smooth the path before I hit play.

### To Do

1. ~~Story Concept ~~
2. Cover Art
 * ~~Stock Art~~
4. Complete Prep
	* ~~Story Summary ~~
	* ~Major Plot Points
	* ~Main Characters
	* ~~Market Research~~
	* Set Up Files & Folders
	* Playlist
5. First Draft
