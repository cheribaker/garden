As of January 2023 I've begun recording my own audiobooks. This page is my reference guide.


## My Equipment

- [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) software (it's free!)
- A Blue Yeti USB Microphone
- A Moukey Isolation Shield and Shock Mount
- Generic over-the-ear Headphones
- A tablet (iPad) for scrolling silently through the book as I narrate.

## My Recording Location

My tiny urban condo lacks any closet or small room suitable for recording, and cities are noisy, so I use my condo building's movie room. It has moderate soundproofing and soft walls. Combined with my microphone's isolation shield, it's not bad!

**Audiobook files need to have a noise floor (silence) of -60DB**. When I choose a quiet time of day, I can record at -56DB. That's pretty close, and I can tweak the noise floor a little when I process the audio files.

## Audiobook as a Proofing Step

To streamline my work, *I'm combining audio recording with proofreading*. Once a chapter is complete and edited twice (content edit + line edit) I begin recording.

When reading work aloud, proofreading errors stand out clearly. I pause the recording, fix the error in the manuscript file, and re-record that sentence, all on the fly.

## Before Recording

- Dress in silent clothing, remove watches, rings, anything that might make noise.
- Set up the microphone, laptop, and tablet at head level. (I prefer to stand! Better voice and energy.)
- Bring a big bottle of water. You'll need it.
- Open manuscript on tablet. Don't TAP the tablet because it will put a thud on the microphone. Slide to advance the text. (SSSHHH!)
- Plug headphones into the microphone so you hear yourself as you go.
- Turn off anything you can that makes noise. (HVAC, Phone, Notifications, etc.)
- Warm up the voice!

## When Starting a New Project

- Record and save 10 seconds of "room tone" (silence). You'll need it when adding pauses during editing. Every room's "silence" sounds different.

## Useful Commands in Audacity

- SHIFT + R: Record
- Spacebar: STOP/PLAY
- SHIFT + D: Punch and Roll

### Punch and Roll

*For backing up and re-starting when you've messed up.*

Place the marker (line) before your spoken error or flub. Hit SHIFT + D and the previous five seconds will play. You can speak over your own voice here just to get in the rhythm! At the marker, recording will resume. Just keep on narrating from there.

*more to come...*
