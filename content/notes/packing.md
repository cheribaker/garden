# Packing & Preparing For a Long Trip

How I get ready for trips that last 1-6 months.

## Gear

 **I carry a Farpoint 40L Travel Backpack plus a large purse.**

Why a backpack?
- It's big enough for a week's worth of clothes, but small enough to be carried on most flights.
- I can carry all my gear for a few miles over uneven terrain (curbs, train stations, stairs)

Why a large purse?
- It lets me carry my laptop, wallet, and medication on my person when my backpack is stowed out of reach.
- It works as a laptop bag when I'm working at a coffee shop.
- It works as a purse also.
- Tip: get one with a zipper top so your stuff doesn't fall out when you stick it beneath an airplane seat.

I don't like large purses, and I prefer not to carry one at all, but this setup works well for me when I'm away from home.


## Packing

* I've learned to *underpack*, bringing less stuff than I'll need.
* I prioritize things that are difficult or expensive to buy. Usually that means a couple pairs of pants that fit my short legs, a packable coat and a packable raincoat, a wool sweater, and a few well-fitting bras. On top of that, I throw in some socks, underwear, shirts, one non-wrinkling dress nice enough for dinner out, and a pair of flats. Plus my toiletry kit and a first aid kit.
* There are three keys to traveling light:
	* Plan to do laundry.
	* Plan to buy a few items while you travel.
	* Bring enough clothes that you have a few layered outfits that you can add-to or subtract-from depending upon the weather.
* Liquids are a problem when you travel carry-on. I limit myself to one tiny bag with:
	* a mini toothpaste
	* a mini hand sanitizer
	* my favorite moisturizer (hard to find overseas)
* When we land in a new place, we eat and we sleep, then our next stop is a grocery store. We pick up toiletries, including toothpaste, shampoo, and so on.
* If you travel with medication, check on your supply at least a month before you leave. You may need to request extra from your doctor. In rare cases, prescribed medications may be illegal in another country. Look yours up before you go.

## Electronics and Communications

**Cell Phone**

* My US cell phone plan *can* be used in other countries, but it's expensive, so I don't use it unless there's an emergency.
* I purchase an E-SIM plan from [Ubigi](https://www.ubigi.com/) (there are other providers) and add an "extra" cell phone plan with mobile data to my phone for as long as we're away. Last time, I paid about $10/mo for cellular data in Spain.
* I upgraded my iPhone SE to one that has E-SIM capability for this purpose.
* Note: Having a Sim+E-SIM is handy because both lines are active simultaneously. My regular line is running in case we get a call from a relative, but all my data goes through the much cheaper Ubigi plan.

**Plugs**

* I carry a universal plug adapter like [this one](https://www.amazon.com/EPICKA-Universal-Travel-Adapter-Power/dp/B078S3M2NX). It's a bit bulky, but having all the plugs in one unit is nice if you don't want to be hunting for a new converter when you go someplace unexpected.


## Communicating in a Foreign Language

**Phrasebooks**

* I like to travel with a phrase book from either Rick Steves or Lonely Planet. They're small, they work without an internet connection, and they help you pronounce things correctly. Also, simply by placing one on the table at a restaurant servers will take pity on you.

**Apps**

* I download Google Translate onto my phone, including the offline language pack for wherever I'll be. You can use your camera to live-translate text, which is helpful when you are in a restaurant with a big menu.


## Preparing to Enter Another Country

**Safety**

* Always check the State Department website (Americans) for rules, warnings, and concerns about where you're visiting. Conditions can change quickly. In 2017, we spent a peaceful month in Santiago Chile, and two years later, the train station we'd used was firebombed. Instead of thinking about "safe" and "unsafe" countries, recognize that *any* country can go through tumultuous times. It's up to you to be aware.
* Register for the State Department's Safe Traveler Program.
* Memorize the country's emergency telephone number (Usually it's not 911) and consider putting it into your phone along with the number of your country's embassy.

**Border Control**
* Likewise, check your country's embassy website. Make sure you understand the rules of entering the country. Do you need a Visa? How long can you stay? Many countries want proof of your exit ticket, and information about where you'll be staying. I like to have a printed copy of our itinerary on hand in case we get asked these questions.
