**My July Project: Speed Running a Mystery Novel**

I started writing [*The Case of the Paper Horse*](/notes/paper-horse.md) this spring, but I never really found my footing. After a few months working on a different project, *Paper Horse* finally feels ready to go!

I suppose the book needed more time to simmer. That, and I needed to get [*Outlaw Justice*](/notes/project-mars.md) out of my brain before my brain exploded.

Check! My brain has not exploded. This is good.

Anyway, I deleted my crappy first attempt at writing *Paper Horse*, and I'm starting over with a wordcount of zero. Because I'm feeling perky, impatient, and overly caffeinated, I'm going to try to write this one NaNoWriMo style. One month to finish the first draft. 

It's been a while since I've done a speedrun like this. ðŸ˜Ž 

I'm starting with a general sense of who the characters are, what the crime is, and how the crime might be resolved. I'm still pantsing though, so we'll see what happens. My loosey goosey plan is to draft this mystery then edit Outlaw Justice starting August 1st.

**Today,** I reviewed my notes, busted out my calendar, and marked off the days I can't write in July. That includes two admin days, a couple appointments I'd already set, plus one full day off per week because everyone needs time off, even during a speed run. 

**I estimate I'll need to write about 2700 words per day to finish the novel by the end of July.**

Can I do it? Will it blow up in my face? No fricking idea! Should be fun though.

See ya in the morning, Ellie...
