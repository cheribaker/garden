*Notes on my novel-in-process. Spoilers are possible. Read at your own risk.*

### Status
*Updated: 8/30/22*

I'm getting ready to write. I've got two years' worth of scattered notes and partial outlines that need to be corralled into something useful. :)

The initial name I picked for the story doesn't feel quite right...

### To Do

1. ~~Story Concept (for full series)~~
2. ~~Cover Art~~
3. Complete Prep
	* ~~Story Summary~~
	* ~Major Plot Points
	* ~Main Characters
	* ~~Market Research~~
	* ~~Set Up Files & Folders~~
	* ~Playlist
4. First Draft

### Writing Playlist

* [Hyperspace Drifter by Stilz](https://newretrowave.bandcamp.com/album/hyperspace-drifter-3)
* [Atlantis by Marvel 83](https://marvel83.bandcamp.com/album/atlantis)
* Probably something from [Tangerine Dream](https://www.tangerinedreammusic.com/)
