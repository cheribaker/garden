The trouble with "pantsing" a novel is that sometimes you come to the end of your mental runway.I had a pretty clear idea of what the first few chapters would be about, but now we're in the full-on pantsy pants zone, which means there's always a risk of reaching a point where I say:

Okay... what happens next?

There are a few ways to deal with this. When I'm not speedrunning, I'll usually stop writing and give myself a day or two to cogitate on the possibilities. Almost always I figure out the next step within 48 hours. Sometimes, it's enough to take a walk and think it through. Or I can even zoom ahead and write a future chapter, one that I'm pretty sure about, then backtrack when I've filled in the gaps.

The bottom line is this: I have to trust Creative Brain because she'll figure things out. She always has. Sometimes Creative Brain wakes me up at 4am and shouts GO-GO-GO and other times she mutters sleepily for a few days before telling me what happens next in the story. We're partners, in a sense, and one doesn't shout at their partner or make unreasonable demands.

So much writing advice is terrible. I've heard thunderous applause at conferences for writers who suggest creatively abusing themselves, using every spare second of the day to whip their Creative Brains like a laboring horse. We must be kinder to our selves, I think.

So I'll go into the book today without much runway, and we'll see what happens. Perhaps it will be longer than I think? Maybe I'll need a long walk after lunch. Or perhaps today's wordcount won't be as high as the artificial number I've set. I have to be open to all those possibilities.

Moreover, writing is more fun when I don't worry about this stuff.  Just let the book happen as it happens! It's strange, but writing works best when I acknowledge that I'm not fully in control. I no longer whip my Creative Brain or tell her that she has to produce OR ELSE. She's precious to me, so let's work together and see what we manage to come up with.

Therefore... Into the book we go!
