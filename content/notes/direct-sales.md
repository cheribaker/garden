*Notes on a project in process.*

### Status
We're developing the first version of our store, which will sell e-books only. In the near future, we'll add paperback sales.

### Goals
- To reduce dependence on e-commerce platforms like Amazon.
- To increase royalties per sale.
- To provide better customer service to our readers.
- To retain control over key business decisions.

## Limitations
- We use Bookfunnel for ebook distribution, so we needed to select e-commerce tools that are compatible with Bookfunnel webhooks.
- We use Mailerlite for customer communications, ideally our store will be compatible so we don't need to manually import customers between systems.

## Tech Stack (1.0)
- Shopify  (Store, Cart, & Payment Processing)
- Bookfunnel (eBook delivery & multi-device customer support)
- Lulu Express (Print on Demand)
- Mailerlite  (Customer Communications)

## Tricky Bits
* Global tax compliance ðŸ˜¬
* Reader comfort level with buying from an unfamiliar place
	* "How does the book get on my device?"
* Managing expectations around KU/Non-KU ebooks. 

## Current Priorities
- Developing policies (Privacy, Returns, etc)
- Creating store assets (Product photos, etc)
- Reader education (How this works, what to expect, FAQ, etc)
