Thus when we see an umbrella, it's like seeing someone walk around in snow pants in the desert.\n\n*LOL.*\n\nNote: When you're dressed to the nines, no one will begrudge you a brief umbrella use to keep your hair dry while you transit from car to fancy-place. There are times when umbrellas are *not* silly.\n\nRelevant Link: [Seattle Man Sells Out to Big Umbrella](https://theneedling.com/2021/10/01/seattle-man-sells-out-to-big-umbrella/)\n\n**Saying \"Pike's Place\" when referring to Pike Place Market**\n\nThere's no possessive. Pike is a street. Say it correctly (Pike Place) and you'll have instant credibility. \n\n**You're doing WHAT on vacation?**\n\nStarbucks is a big national chain store. That's why we find it a bit weird when tourists are *delighted* to visit a Starbucks here. The \"First Starbucks\" isn't even the first Starbucks, because the first one was torn down years ago. You're welcome to wait in line for an hour and buy an overpriced mug there, but yes... it's a bit of a head scratcher.\n\n### Local Lingo\n\n\"The mountain is out\" = Mt. Rainier is visible. Always cause for happiness! Someday it will explode and take out half the region, but until then: *ain't she pretty?*\n\n\"Eat a bag of Dick's\" = Dick's burgers is a delicious, inexpensive, and beloved burger joint. Sometimes you're hungry and on a budget and you will crave a bag of Dick's.\n\n\"Sunbreak\" = During our long dark (5-8 months of gray skies) the sun will occasionally shine down. This is a sunbreak and it's an immediate excuse to slack off at work and go outside.\n\n### **Personal Space**\n\nWe like our personal space! Much like the British, Seattleites tend to queue up in line while waiting. We avoid crowding when we can, and most of us avoid extemporaneous conversation with people we don't know, especially on the streets. Certainly ask people for directions if you need them; it's fine to be friendly! It's just that chatting a stranger's ear off will earn you some strange looks.\n\nAs in many cities, wearing earbuds is the universal symbol for \"don't talk to me unless you really need to.\"\n\nWe're more like cats than we are like dogs. Cats have friends, but they tend to circle each other warily for a little while before making up their minds.\n\n### Stand on the Right; Pass on the Left\n\nWhen riding up an escalator in busy areas, stand single file to allow fast walkers to pass you on the side. Try to avoid clotting up stairways, escalators, and sidewalks. We're fast walkers and often on the move.\n\n### JCMSUP (The Downtown Grid)\n\nElliott Bay runs along the west side of downtown. That's the waterfront. From there, facing east toward the landmass, you can count the numbered avenues *up*.  (Western, 1st Ave, 2nd Ave, 3rd Ave) The cross-streets, from *South to North*, follow a pattern that you can remember with one silly phrase:\n\n**Jesus Christ Made Seattle Under Pressure**\n\n(South end of Downtown)\n\n**J**ackson \u0026\n**J**ames\n\n**C**olumbia \u0026\n**C**herry\n\n**M**arion \u0026\n**M**adison\n\n**S**pring \u0026\n**S**eneca\n\n**U**nion \u0026\n**U**niversity\n\n**P**ike \u0026\n**P**ine\n\n(North end of Downtown)\n\n### Casual Clothing is the Norm\n\nJeans and hoodies = *the local uniform.*\n\nREI outerwear = *it's normal to dress like you're headed for a hike, year-round*\n\nBusiness casual = *Usually it's more casual than other cities unless you're going for an interview or working in real estate or finance.*\n\n#### Common Local Opinions on Seattle Things\n\n- We have a certain shabby respect for Starbucks as a hometown business, but we tend not to think of it as 'good coffee.' We have a ton of small, quirky, delicious coffee shops, and it's always nice to try something new. \n- No one gives a rip about *Sleepless in Seattle*. Ditto *Grey's Anatomy*. The connection is superficial at best.\n- We are proud of our musical history, including but not limited to *Nirvana*, *Sir Mixalot*, *Grunge Bands*, and *JImi Hendrix*.\n- We are still salty about the loss of our NBA team, the *Seattle Supersonics*.\n- Stereotypical things we're generally fond of: Hiking and Camping, Boating and Watersports, Aerospace, Technology, Coffee, Libraries, Rain, Working too Much, Beer, Music Festivals, Weed, and Seafood.\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-01T02:17:54.01853348Z","tags":null},"/notes/direct-sales":{"title":"Setting up an Author E-commerce Site","content":"\n*Notes on a project in process.*\n\n### Status\nWe're developing the first version of our store, which will sell e-books only.

Nanowrimo is an annual event where writers all over the world attempt to finish a novel (or 50,000 words) in the month of November. It‚Äôs a fun time to work on a writing project because there are several thousand other people working towards the same goal.\n\nI‚Äôve never officially ‚Äúwon‚Äù Nano, but it‚Äôs fun to participate, and most of my Nano projects were completed and published after the fact. The only problem with Nanowrimo (in my opinion) is that the standard goal of 50k words in 30 days isn‚Äôt practical for most people- especially those with full-time jobs, family obligations, and the all the writers who feel creatively blocked under rising pressure. Falling behind on your word count is super discouraging if you believe the 50,000 word number is all that matters, and it sucks when new writers feel discouraged for no good reason.\n\nMy solution? Let‚Äôs half-ass Nanowrimo! We can set our own goals, have fun, participate, and hold the whole thing lightly.\n\nI think I‚Äôll write my second cruise ship mystery in November. I estimate it will be a 40,000 word project, but in the end it will be as long as it needs to be. And for the rest of October I‚Äôll send out a short blog post each week about preparing for Nanowrimo. If you want to, you‚Äôre welcome to follow along. Then in November we‚Äôll be ready to half-ass our dreams.\n\nWhen it comes to the arts, there‚Äôs this really tricky line between taking your art seriously and being so regimented that you smother the joy right out of it. The former is good, and the latter is bad, but too often they feel like the same thing. My hope for this Nanowrimo is that we can give ourselves permission to take our writing aspirations seriously without smothering the flame under too many expectations.\n\nSo consider yourself invited. ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\n### Step One: The Idea\n\nHappy Friday! Today‚Äôs post is about preparing for [National Novel Writing Month](https://nanowrimo.org/) . Our first step in preparation is to come up with an idea for the story. Your idea doesn‚Äôt have to be detailed at this point, but it does help to have a basic notion of what your story will be about.\n\n**Choosing a Story Idea**\n\nHow do you know you‚Äôve got a good story idea? Well, it‚Äôs less about originality than it is about the way it makes you feel. The truth is, there are a zillion different stories you might write, and very few stories are based on an original concept. Two authors could choose an identical idea, but in the process of writing, their books would differ because their life experiences, preferences, and inner voice are all different. **The trick to picking a good story idea is finding one that makes you feel excited and curious.** You‚Äôll be spending lots of time on your story, so you want it to be the kind of story that will continue to draw you in.\n\nHere are a handful of story ideas that I pulled out of my brain:\n\n_Halfway into a three-year journey, the leader of a colony ship discovers the planet they‚Äôre headed toward has been destroyed. In fact, several planets have disappeared off the charts over the last twelve months. And whatever is taking out planets is moving slowly toward Earth. Unfortunately, this colony ship is full of criminals, and the Earth Defense Forces will blow them out of the sky if they dare to turn back‚Ä¶_\n\n_A teenage girl falls in love with her best friend‚Äôs boyfriend, and he with her. But her best friend is very sick with a terminal disease, and the love besotted teens are determined to give their sick friend the best senior year possible._\n\n_Take the basic story from Romeo and Juliet and write it from the perspective of an envious servant who deviously pushes the pair toward suicide while making them think it was their own idea. But they fake their deaths as a way of catching her in the act, and the servant goes to prison. Then the Romeo and Juliet characters live happily ever after._\n\n_Tell a poltergeist story but it‚Äôs a coffee roasting facility that‚Äôs haunted and all the beans that go out are cursed. Whenever someone drinks coffee made from the cursed beans they make bad choices that echo the terrible crimes committed in the coffee roasting facility many years prior._\n\nI jotted down those ideas above at random. But the first story idea on my list is probably the best one. Why? Because it invokes my curiosity. Who are these criminals? Where were they headed? What is destroying planets? What will they decide to do? Any idea that opens a lot of doors is usually a fun one to write about. But all those ideas above are workable. Because I‚Äôm continuing an existing series, I did the brainstorming process with my current heroine, and came up with an idea for her next mystery: _The Case of the Karaoke Killer_.¬† That‚Äôll be my book for November, unless I change my mind between now and then.\n\nSo if you‚Äôre half-assing Nano with me, I suggest you spend time this week writing out story ideas. Cast a wide net! Make a list of five or ten ideas, then pick one that you‚Äôll enjoy spending time with.\n\nIf you‚Äôre feeling stuck, you could do worse than to put a new twist on a story you already know and love. Want to write a story that‚Äôs like _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ IN SPACE? Or how about some _Game of Thrones_-style political intrigue but with cyberpunk war machines instead of dragons? Mixing and matching can be a fun way to brainstorm new ideas.\n\nNext week, we‚Äôll take your idea a step further.\n\n## Step Two: Structure\n\nHello, internet buddies! Let‚Äôs continue our NaNoWriMo prep today with this question: _What is a story?_ Well, even if you can‚Äôt verbalize the answer, you know it intuitively because you‚Äôve been hearing stories all your life! Stories are narratives that follow a familiar structure, and coming up with your story structure is your nanowrimo homework of the week.\n\nHere‚Äôs one example of a story structure. This one is called the [Story Circle](https://channel101.fandom.com/wiki/Story_Structure_101:_Super_Basic_Shit) , and it‚Äôs been popularized over the last few years by television writer Dan Harmon.\n\n**The Story Circle**\n\n**1. Character begins in a zone of comfort.**  \n**2. But they want something.**  \n**3. So they enter an unfamiliar situation.**  \n**4. They adapt to it.**  \n**5. And get what they wanted.**  \n**6. But pay a heavy price.**  \n**7. Then they return to a familiar situation.**  \n**8. Having changed.**\n\nIn my most recent novel, _[The Assistant](https://cheribaker.com/books/the-assistant/)_ , what Jessica Warne wants more than anything is to gain respect, stability, and financial security. She‚Äôs somewhat representative of the Millennial generation, in that she‚Äôs smart and hard working while also being deeply in debt, underutilized, and stuck in a shitty job with few prospects. So when she gets a job offer from a high end staffing firm that offers her huge pay, big challenges, and an all-expenses paid makeover, she‚Äôs over the moon! Finally, she‚Äôs been given the opportunity to prove her skills and become a successful adult. The Duke Agency offers Jessica a path to what she wants, but what will joining the agency cost her? That question is the entry point to the Emerald City Spies series.\n\nIn fact, I wrote one story circle for that series as a whole, and smaller story circles for each novel within the series. The story circles fit together like LEGO blocks, and I find that to be a satisfying way of holding a narrative together.\n\nNot a fan of the story circle? Here‚Äôs another sample story structure that I found online and jotted down a while ago. (I don‚Äôt know who came up with it, but I‚Äôll update this post if I can find the original source.)\n\n**In order to *Avoid Problem* a *Flawed Character* must *Try To Achieve Goal* but when *Complication Arises* they realize they must overcome *Antagonist* and *Personal Flaw* by *Doing Cool Shit* before *Deadline*.**\n\nNice and compact, right? But you can see how all the big elements of the story are contained within that structure. Have you noticed that stories usually contain both an antagonist (external enemy) and a character flaw (internal enemy)? Perfect characters are dull, and stories that moralize about personal growth without real-world consequences are also dull. That‚Äôs why most stories contain both character growth _and_ an external threat of some kind. Those elements work together to create a satisfying story.\n\nFor those who like lots of detail, you can find story spreadsheets on Jami Gold‚Äôs website that contain more detailed templates for story structures. They‚Äôre a great resource, but personally I prefer to keep my structure loose at this stage to give myself lots of room to play as I‚Äôm drafting the story. But feel free to check the worksheets out if the structures I laid out above feel too vague. I‚Äôm also a big fan of Libby Hawker‚Äôs short book on structure: [Take Off Your Pants.](https://www.amazon.com/Take-Off-Your-Pants-Outline-ebook/dp/B00UKC0GHA)\n\nIt might feel too early to outline your book, and that‚Äôs fine. For now, I want you thinking _big picture_.\n\n### Step Three: Characters, POV, and Setting\n\nWelcome back to our month-long prep for national novel writing month in which I invite you to half-ass NaNoWriMo with me. In week one we talked about coming up with a story idea , and last week we discussed structure. This week‚Äôs prep covers three more elements of story building: Character, Point of View, and Setting. The prep work we do this week will help us write more quickly when we begin drafting our stories in November.\n\n#### Decision #1: Which Point of View Will You Use?\n\nThink of point of view (POV) as the _camera_ you use when telling a story. You might tell your story from inside _one_ character‚Äôs head, using sentences like ‚ÄúI raced down the hall.‚Äù If so, that‚Äôs called first-person perspective. It‚Äôs a fun way to tell a story because the tale unfolds like you are reading someone‚Äôs diary. But there‚Äôs a big limiting factor. You can‚Äôt tell the reader things that your main character doesn‚Äôt know! We can only see what the POV character sees, which is why it‚Äôs a popular choice for murder mysteries.\n\nSo perhaps you‚Äôd like to describe events from outside your main character‚Äôs head? Your sentences will read more like this: ‚ÄúErin raced down the hall.‚Äù This is third-person perspective. We‚Äôre not inside Erin‚Äôs head the whole time, but we‚Äôre able to follow her closely. If we tell the story from Erin‚Äôs perspective, using a third-person POV, that‚Äôs called third-person _limited_. But that‚Äôs not our only option here. If we‚Äôre careful not to confuse our readers, we can also switch our camera between different characters in third-person. We could write one chapter from Erin‚Äôs point of view, then another chapter from her adversary‚Äôs point of view, for example. This is helpful when we‚Äôre following different groups of people, or when we want to build suspense by showing what the bad guys are up to.\n\n_Tip:_ If you‚Äôre using third person to tell the story through the eyes of multiple characters, keep the number of POV characters limited. Juggling a bunch of POV characters is difficult to do, and too many camera angles may alienate readers who get invested in one character only to have you hop into someone else‚Äôs head.\n\nLastly, we have Omniscient point of view. Common in epic fantasy, omniscient POV is where there is a narrator who knows all things, and they are telling us the story. Omniscient point of view pulls the camera way out and provides a panoramic view of events across different groups of people, places, and even different points in time.\n\nA quick note about tense: We also get to choose whether we will write our story in _past tense_ or _present tense_. Present tense is less common, but it‚Äôs become more prevalent in YA novels and some thrillers. Most novels will be written in past tense, telling us what happened, not what is happening. If you‚Äôre curious about what effective present tense looks like, check out The Hunger Games trilogy.\n\nSo your first decision for the week is this: what POV will you write in? If you aren‚Äôt sure, it‚Äôs smart to follow the conventions of your chosen genre. Murder mysteries are all past tense, for example, and can be told in either first person or third. If it helps, pull a few books from your preferred genre off the shelf and flip through the pages. What point of view do they use? Emulating others is a fine place to start.\n\n#### Decision #2: Who Are My Characters?\n\nFor each of your primary characters, I‚Äôll suggest that you fill out a quick character sheet that summarizes important facts about them. Here‚Äôs an example of what goes into a character sheet, but you can include any categories you like:\n\n_Name:_  \n_Age:_  \n_Appearance:_  \n_Clothing/Style:_  \n_Mannerisms:_  \n_Family Situation/Important Relationships:_  \n_Education:_  \n_Nationality/Group Membership:_  \n_Positive Traits:_  \n_Quirks:_  \n_Flaws:_  \n_How they Respond to Stress:_  \n_Goals:_\n\n_Tip:_ Don‚Äôt worry if your characters feel ‚Äúflat on the page‚Äù at this point, because if you are anything like me, you‚Äôll get to know your characters as you write them. You‚Äôll be writing a scene and their personalities will come busting out, surprising you. But it definitely helps to have some of the basics ironed out, like names, appearance, and a few personality traits. This will keep your words flowing instead of stopping you up every time you need to come up with a name. This also helps when you need to remember a fact mid-story. Checking a character sheet is easier than paging through a hundred pages of text to make sure you didn‚Äôt change someone‚Äôs name or hair color mid-book.\n\nSome writers also add a stock photo or celebrity photo to their character sheets, ‚Äúcasting the character‚Äù to make it easier to describe them when the moment comes. If that helps you out, go for it! Also, some writers ‚Äúget into the zone‚Äù by doing some freewriting (journaling) from the perspective of their main character. I‚Äôve done that a time or two, but usually I just dive into the story itself and let the characters show up.\n\n_Tip:_ Need help coming up with character names? Check out [this generator](https://blog.reedsy.com/character-name-generator/) and [popular names in the USA by decade.](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/decades/) The latter is helpful when you want to name characters via their age. A 30 year old might be a Jessica, and a 50 year old might be a Heather, for example.\n\n#### Decision #3: What are my Major Settings?\n\nLastly, it can help things along during NaNoWriMo if you know what your major settings are. Will your scenes take place in an office? A mall? A spaceship? I like to pull photographs and illustrations of settings I might use off the web and stick them in a research folder. I don‚Äôt spend a lot of time on this, but that way when I want to describe a room or setting I can pull up a photo and use it as a reference. Wikipedia is a good resource for snagging details about different cities.\n\nThat‚Äôs it! This week‚Äôs work will help you hit the ground running once Nano begins. We‚Äôve got two more posts in this Nano prep series. Next week I‚Äôll cover outlining, an optional step, and in our final week we‚Äôll discuss workspace, time management, and mindset.\n\n#### Let‚Äôs Get Ready for Nano!\n\nTo recap, here‚Äôs your suggested homework for the week: **Take your story idea from last week and apply some structure to it.** Use big, broad strokes, and think about how your story will flow. Where does your main character begin? What is their goal? What will be their main plan to reach that goal? Where will they fall down? And how will they be changed by the time your reader reaches the final page?\n\nThink it through, and jot down some notes, but don‚Äôt stress if you feel it‚Äôs too early to make these decisions. Some writers like to go into their story completely planless, and you might be one of them. But for me, having a loose structure defined stops me from flailing too much during the first draft, so I encourage you to think those questions through.\n\nNext time, we‚Äôll do some time-saving prep work as we tackle _Characters_, _Point of View_, and _Setting_.\n\n## Step Four: Beat Sheets\nWelcome back to my Preparing for Nanowrimo series! We‚Äôre just a few weeks away now and _shit‚Äôs about to get real_. But no worries! If you‚Äôve been prepping along with me you have your story idea plus a bit of structure, also known as your story arc. Perhaps you‚Äôve jotted down some notes about your characters and chosen a point of view to write from. If so, you‚Äôre already well ahead of the game. For me, this stage in the writing process feels exciting but messy. Today we‚Äôll add some specificity to our writing plan to help us hit the ground running on November 1st.\n\nThis week I recommend you create something called a **beat sheet** for your story. A beat sheet is a bullet point list of the major events in your story. I used to call this step _outlining_, but in all honesty I hate the concept of outlining because it feels too rigid. So I think of my beat sheet as _pre-writing_. I‚Äôm smoothing the path by laying down some ideas I can expand upon.\n\nA story ‚Äúbeat‚Äù is a small piece of action that moves your story forward. Think of it like a note of music, leading to another note, and another.\n\nHere‚Äôs a sample of two beats from a cruise ship mystery I just drafted: _The Case of the Missing Finger_\n\n\u003e DAY ONE: MID-DAY BOARDING ‚Äì SUNDAY ‚Äì MIAMI\n\u003e \n\u003e -   Ellie admires the cruise ship. The S/V Adventurous Spirit is far bigger than she‚Äôd imagined and she compares it against what she read in the brochure two years prior. It‚Äôs very white and has tropical birds painted on the hull. She wishes Ronnie were there with her, but reminds herself that he wouldn‚Äôt want her feeling sorry for herself.\n\u003e -   Her daughter in law comes up beside her, making noise. She loves her DIL, but her concern-trolling is a bit much. Does Ellie have X, does she have Y? DIL _hates_ the thought of Ellie being alone on the ship. It‚Äôs too bad she couldn‚Äôt wait for all of them to go. Ellie remarks that she won‚Äôt be alone, she has 1,XXX new friends. She says this, but inside she‚Äôs feeling nervous. Mostly she sees couples and families. Was taking this cruise alone a mistake? She hopes she won‚Äôt be lonely. But it can‚Äôt be worse than moping around at home. She‚Äôs tired of feeling sad.\n\nEarlier, when we talked about structure , I mentioned that your character will likely start out in a zone of comfort (or a status quo) but they _want_ something. My opening beats establish who Ellie is, what she wants, and what she‚Äôs leaving behind. Over the early chapters we learn that she‚Äôs widowed and that she loves her family, but she‚Äôs also craving more adventure in her life. From there I move into the plot of the murder mystery.\n\nYour ‚Äúbeats‚Äù might be a single sentence, a paragraph, or something longer. It‚Äôs up to you! What we‚Äôre doing here is taking our prior prep work (structure, character, setting) and fluffing them out into a list of events.\n\n_Tip:_ I‚Äôve _never_ been able to define the final few beats of my story. I leave those blank, because I know I won‚Äôt know what the final scenes look like until I arrive there. So don‚Äôt worry if that happens to you too. This isn‚Äôt a school assignment and you aren‚Äôt being graded. Do it your own way.\n\n### Tips for Building Your Beat Sheet\n\nBeat sheets are optional. You might prefer to sit down without one and just crank the words. But I find having a beat sheet helpful because I can take a beat and paste it into a document for the day, then expand it out to a full scene. This is far easier (for me) than generating every single scene on the fly.\n\nHere are some things that might happen when you try to make a beat sheet:\n\n1.  You write some beats, then you read them, then you think BOY THIS IS BORING. That‚Äôs helpful! It‚Äôs your signal to come up with some exciting events to spice up your story.\n    \n2.  You write five or ten beats, then you‚Äôre not sure what happens next. That‚Äôs fine! You might come back tomorrow with more ideas, or you might want to start with those initial ideas and take it from there. There‚Äôs no wrong way to do this.\n    \n3.  You make a beat-sheet for your full novel, but it seems a bit sparse in sections. No biggie! You‚Äôll find yourself adding more depth and detail in the moment as you write. Some of us write ‚Äúthin‚Äù beat sheets then thicken up the story considerably as we write.\n    \n4.  You make a beat sheet and use it, but then you find your story is diverting off the path you set. That‚Äôs cool! You can adjust your beat sheet as you go, because we don‚Äôt always see the story in full until we start writing it. That‚Äôs normal and pretty darn fun. A surprised writer can mean surprised readers too.\n    \n5.  You start making a beat sheet, but you get all jazzed and some of your ‚Äúbeats‚Äù are getting really long and detailed like scenes. Awesome! You might be doing some early writing before Nano starts, but I‚Äôm not going to rat you out.\n    \n\nFor this week‚Äôs nano prep, my suggestion is that you try to write a beat sheet for your novel, or at least for the first part of your story. Can you make Nanowrimo easier by laying down some beats before you start writing? If so, go for it.\n\nFuture-you might be very glad you did. üôÇ\n\n## Step Five: Mindset\nHey, Nano preppers! We‚Äôre just a few days away from the big event, so I‚Äôll wrap up this Nanowrimo prep series with some tips about mindset. How should we _think_ about our writing? And what attitudes should we adopt in order to complete our projects well? I‚Äôve got a few suggestions, which I‚Äôve listed below in the form of beliefs.¬† Do you agree with these beliefs, and if so, are you ready to adopt them?\n\n#### Belief #1: Writing requires time and effort, so I‚Äôve made space in my life to do it.\n\nWriting is work, right? It‚Äôs work in the same way that going to your day job is work. If you put in the time and make an effort, you‚Äôll make it through and you‚Äôll improve your skills over time. And because we learn by writing, not by worrying about our writing, action is what matters.\n\nThat begins by making time, space, and energy available for your November writing project.\n\n#### Belief #2: I‚Äôm writing a first draft. Later, I‚Äôll improve it.\n\nWriting a first draft is about telling the story to yourself. You can trust your future-self to edit your story, and focus now on the first task which is getting the whole story down so you can look at it. Nanowrimo isn‚Äôt the time to perfect your ‚Äúfirst page hook‚Äù or obsess about comma placement.\n\nThat being said, you‚Äôre not required to write a shitty first draft!¬† I‚Äôd rather see you produce the best work you can, right now, given your current skill level. Let‚Äôs talk for a moment about the notion of the happy medium, when it comes to the quality of your first draft.\n\n#### Finding the Happy Medium\n\n‚Äú_I‚Äôll just write shit because that‚Äôs what a first draft is._‚Äù¬† Nah. Why on Earth would you intentionally write shit?\n\n‚Äú_I won‚Äôt start chapter two until chapter one is AMAZING._‚Äù¬† Nope! You‚Äôre being too rigid. First drafts aren‚Äôt amazing. You‚Äôll be stuck in a perfectionist loop!\n\n‚Äú_I‚Äôll write this scene to the best of my current ability. Then I‚Äôll move on to the next, because this is FIRST DRAFT TIME, baby!_‚Äù¬† Perfect! You‚Äôve found the happy medium.\n\nSeek out that happy medium, okay?\n\n#### Belief #3: It‚Äôs time to listen to my gut and heart. Not the experts.\n\nYou‚Äôve probably internalized a lot of advice from other writers, right? Stephen King hates adverbs. Others advise against prologues. Your high school English teacher yelled at you for using sentence fragments, or starting a sentence with _and_. Yadda Yadda_._ Taken in context, writing advice can be useful. But for a beginner, all this advice becomes an extra voice of criticism, making you second-guess your natural style as you start writing.\n\n_Tip:_ You‚Äôre fine. Just write! Use the voice that comes naturally to you. Fix any excesses in editing, and stop worrying about what the experts think. It‚Äôs not their story. It‚Äôs yours!\n\n#### Belief #4: Progress matters, but progress is not linear.\n\nYou might have this idealized notion that you‚Äôll write X words per day during Nanowrimo. And goals can be motivating sometimes. But in reality, writing is far more‚Ä¶ lumpy than you might expect. You might have a day where you squeak out 200 words during lunch, and another day when you write four chapters because the words won‚Äôt stop flowing. It‚Äôs okay to have general targets in mind, but don‚Äôt flip out if you‚Äôre not producing equal numbers of words.\n\nKeep it simple. Every time you write, move your story forward. And try to set aside enough hours in the month to reach your overall goal. That‚Äôs really all you can do.\n\n#### Belief #5: No one is forcing me to do this.\n\nWrite because you love it. Or because it challenges you. Or because you‚Äôre curious to see if you can. Write because you‚Äôve got a story to tell, or because you‚Äôve admired authors forever and books still feel like magic.\n\nBut if writing is making you miserable, or if you hate it, it‚Äôs okay to stop. Don‚Äôt turn a story into an ego contest with yourself. Remember, no one is forcing you to do it. Proceed with the intention that you‚Äôll enjoy yourself, and see how it goes.\n\n#### Belief #6: I‚Äôll decide what to do with this story later.\n\nYou might publish your story, or not. You might give it to friends to read, or not. But my point is, you don‚Äôt need to worry about any of that now. Get the draft down, edit it later, and then you can decide what to do.\n\nYour story is a squalling little baby made of words. It‚Äôs red-faced and shouty and it has no career plans or life goals. So put away the college pamphlets and let it grow up a little. Let your story exist for its own sake! Don‚Äôt squash it under all your bossy expectations.\n\nAnd that leads me to my most important belief, which is this:\n\n#### Belief #7: I‚Äôm a writer.\n\nIf you write, you‚Äôre a writer. There‚Äôs no secret-handshake, certification, or permission slip required. Drop the word ‚Äúaspiring‚Äù from your vocabulary and flush your impostor syndrome down the toilet. Once you accept the reality that you‚Äôre a writer, you can stop being all angsty about labels and _do your damn job._\n\nYou can write.\n\nNanowrimo might be the start of something lasting, or perhaps just a fun month to try something new. Either answer is fine, but time spent worrying about labels is wasted time. Imagine me smacking you upside the head with THE OFFICIAL SCEPTER OF ALL WRITERS. Boom. You‚Äôre a writer! Now get to work.\n\nThis concludes my Nanowrimo prep series, and I hope you‚Äôve found it helpful. Good luck with your story, and feel free to drop me a comment during the month of November to tell me how your project is going. And if you‚Äôd like some _in-person_ camaraderie during the month of November, there are plenty of local meetup groups being organized on the official [Nanowrimo](http://www.nanowrimo.org) website right now.\n\nHappy writing!\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-01T02:17:54.022533498Z","tags":null},"/notes/preview-changes":{"title":"Preview Changes","content":"\nIf you'd like to preview what your Quartz site looks like before deploying it to the internet, here's exactly how to do that!\n\nNote that both of these steps need to be completed.\n\n## Install `hugo-obsidian`\nThis step will generate the list of backlinks for Hugo to parse.
