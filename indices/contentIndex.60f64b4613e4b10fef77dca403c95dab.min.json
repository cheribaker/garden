Thus when we see an umbrella, it's like seeing someone walk around in snow pants in the desert.\n\n*LOL.*\n\nNote: There are times when umbrellas are *not* silly. And no one is going to hassle you. We just think it's funny.\n\nRelevant Link: [Seattle Man Sells Out to Big Umbrella](https://theneedling.com/2021/10/01/seattle-man-sells-out-to-big-umbrella/)\n\n**Saying \"Pike's Place\" when referring to Pike Place Market**\n\nThere's no possessive. Pike is a street. Say it correctly (Pike Place) and you'll have instant credibility. \n\n**You're doing WHAT on vacation?**\n\nStarbucks is a big national chain store. That's why we find it a bit weird when tourists are *delighted* to visit a Starbucks here. The \"First Starbucks\" isn't even the first Starbucks because the first one was torn down years ago. You're welcome to wait in line for an hour and buy an overpriced mug there, but yes... it's a bit of a head scratcher.\n\n### Local Lingo\n\n\"The mountain is out\" = Mt. Rainier is visible. Always cause for happiness! Someday it will explode and take out half the region, but until then: *ain't she pretty?*\n\n\"Eat a bag of Dick's\" = Dick's burgers is a delicious, inexpensive, and beloved burger joint. Sometimes, you're hungry and on a budget and you will crave a bag of Dick's.\n\n\"Sunbreak\" = During our long dark (5-8 months of gray skies) the sun will occasionally shine down. This is a sunbreak and it's an immediate excuse to slack off at work and go outside.\n\n\"The Seattle Freeze\" = The idea that it's difficult to make friends here. It's both true and untrue. Meetups, group hikes, and volunteering are all good ways to make friends in the area.\n\n### **Personal Space**\n\nWe like our personal space! Much like the British, Seattleites tend to queue up in line while waiting. We avoid crowding when we can, and many of us avoid extemporaneous conversation with people we don't know, especially on the streets. Certainly ask people for directions if you need them; it's fine to be friendly! It's just that chatting a stranger's ear off may earn you some strange looks.\n\nAs in many cities, wearing earbuds is the universal symbol for \"don't talk to me unless you really need to.\"\n\nWe're more like cats than we are like dogs. Cats have friends, but they tend to circle each other warily for a little while before making up their minds.\n\n### Stand on the Right; Pass on the Left\n\nWhen riding up an escalator in busy areas, stand single file to allow fast walkers to pass you on the side. Try to avoid clotting up stairways, escalators, and sidewalks. On average we're fast walkers.\n\n### JCMSUP (The Downtown Grid)\n\nElliott Bay runs along the west side of downtown. That's the waterfront. From there, facing east toward the landmass, you can count the numbered avenues *up*.  (Western, 1st Ave, 2nd Ave, 3rd Ave) The cross-streets, from *South to North*, follow a pattern that you can remember with one silly phrase:\n\n**Jesus Christ Made Seattle Under Pressure**\n\n(South end of Downtown)\n\n**J**ackson \u0026\n**J**ames\n\n**C**olumbia \u0026\n**C**herry\n\n**M**arion \u0026\n**M**adison\n\n**S**pring \u0026\n**S**eneca\n\n**U**nion \u0026\n**U**niversity\n\n**P**ike \u0026\n**P**ine\n\n(North end of Downtown)\n\n### Casual Clothing is the Norm\n\nJeans and hoodies = *the local uniform.*\n\nREI outerwear = *it's normal to dress like you're headed for a hike, year-round*\n\nBusiness casual = *Usually it's more casual than other cities unless you're going for an interview or working in real estate or finance.*\n\n#### Common Local Opinions on Seattle Things\n\n- ~~We have a certain shabby respect for Starbucks as a hometown business~~, but we tend not to think of it as 'good coffee.' We have a ton of small, quirky, delicious coffee shops, and it's always nice to try something new.  *Update: Starbucks has trashed itself by engaging in aggressive and illegal union busting practices*\n- No one gives a rip about *Sleepless in Seattle*. Ditto *Grey's Anatomy*. The connection is superficial at best.\n- We are proud of our musical history, including but not limited to *Nirvana*, *Sir Mixalot*, *Grunge Bands*, and *JImi Hendrix*.\n- We are still salty about the loss of our NBA team, the *Seattle Supersonics*.\n- Things we're generally fond of: Hiking and Camping, Boating, Aerospace, Technology, Coffee, Libraries, Rain, Working too Much, Beer, Music Festivals, Weed, and Seafood.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-28T13:31:53.466756311Z","tags":[""]},"/notes/direct-sales":{"title":"Setting up an E-Commerce Bookstore","content":"\nNotes and lessons learned on setting up an e-commerce site to sell e-books directly. This project was a two-person effort. I (Cheri) did most of the design work and Patrick did the coding and customization.\n\n### Status\nSite is [Live](http://www.cheribaker.com).\n\n### Goals\n- To reduce dependence on third-party e-commerce platforms like Amazon.\n- To increase royalties per sale.\n- To provide better customer service to our readers.\n- To retain control over key business decisions.\n- To make DRM-free ebooks available for customers who prefer them.\n\n## Limitations\n- We use Bookfunnel for ebook distribution, so we needed to select e-commerce tools that are compatible with Bookfunnel webhooks.\n- We use Mailerlite for customer communications, ideally our store will be compatible so we don't need to manually import customers between systems.\n\n## Technology\n- Shopify  (Store, Cart, \u0026 Secure Payment Processing)\n- Bookfunnel (eBook delivery \u0026 multi-device customer support)\n- Mailerlite  (Customer Communications)\n\nShopify is great because it's powerful in the things that matter (secure payment processing, reporting) and because it integrates with a lot of services we use (Bookfunnel, MailerLite), but it also sucks at times because features which would seem very basic are sometimes missing. They offer many features as \"plug ins\" but almost every plugin comes with a monthly fee.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Shopify frequently updates their themes, so if you've written custom code, you'll need to check for compatibility when you update your theme to the latest version. It's probably smart to have a \"light touch\" when modifying the theme iself.\n\nWe briefly considered Gumroad, E-Junkie, and Payhip for our store, but they didn't offer all the features we wanted.\n\n## Features\nI'm particularly happy about these features on our web store:\n- An attractive, clean interface.\n- A \"reading order\" page that updates dynamically to show my books in the correct reading order.\n- Multi-retailer links on every book page.\n- Collections pages for each series. (like [this one](https://www.cheribaker.com/Ellie))\n- Integration with my mailing list software (MailerLite) so I can see what works and what doesn't for sending traffic to the site.\n- Integration with MailerLite also allows me to \"add a product\" from my store directly into a newsletter as a block element. That's handy!\n\nMulti-retailer links and the reading order page (and many other small tweaks) were hand-coded by my partner in crime, Patrick. He does good work! Our site is a lightly modified version of Shopify's \"Dawn\" theme. \n\n## Revisions Since Launch\n\n- We added \"Add to Cart\" buttons on the front page. Initially we liked the clean look of only showing the book covers, but this meant a *lot* of clicking for anyone who wanted to add multiple products to a cart quickly.\n\n## Problems \u0026 Solutions\n\n#### Tax compliance\nTax compliance is a pain in the ass because every location has its own rules and paperwork. Some countries make it easy; you simply don't report anything until you make a certain amount of money in that country. Others require up front registration and continual tax filings even when you make zero money there.\n\nWe currently sell to six markets where I have the most readers:\n* USA\n* Canada\n* UK \n* EU \n* Australia\n* New Zealand\n\nEU tax compliance is difficult because they have a lot of regulatory hoops to jump through, including registration with an intermediary located in the EU. We use a service called *EAS EU \u0026 UK Compliance* that integrates with Shopify. We've also had to register for a UK Vat number, a process that took about four months, and which requires regular tax filings regardless of income.\n\n**Transaction Costs**: Because selling a book to customers in the EU results in a per-transaction compliance cost of 1.25 EU, functionally this means I can't sell any book for less than $2.99 in my store. A 99c short story could end up costing me money with every sale, for example.\n\n#### Policies\nA store is required to have things like a clearly articulated return policy, terms of service, a privacy policy, and a physical address and phone number. Researching our policies and so forth took a while, so I'd recommend starting that process sooner rather than later if you're setting up a store. You may also want an attorney to look over your docs.\n\n#### Multi-Retailer Links\nWhile I would obviously be thrilled if every reader chose to buy books from me directly, it's important that readers have a choice. We handled this by adding a \"retailer links\" section below the buy-buttons on our webstore. It may seem counterintuitive to direct customers AWAY from your store, but this works great because:\n\n- Instead of providing 5-10 different links in every newsletter I send, I can include just one - the one that goes to my store.\n- With every click, readers are reminded that they can buy from me directly (although it's not required)\n- A single canonical link for each book means I'm always sending traffic to my own website.\n- It makes it easy for readers to find the store they want.\n\n*note: Patrick coded this addition for us*\n\n#### Reader Education\nPeople may be nervous about inputting their credit card into a website they don't know. They may also be nervous about buying a book directly from a website, especially if they're used to using a particular store app.  I've added a FAQ and some language to explain things, but this will likely be a hurdle to overcome.\n\n#### Payment Processors\nWe've set up standard credit card processing, Shopify Payments (Shop Pay), Google Pay, and Apple Pay. It appears that Apple Pay works great on iOS devices but it requires using the Safari browser.\n\nI was tempted to add Paypal as a payment option, because they're popular, but I've read too many stories about small businesses being screwed over by Paypal without recourse.\n\n#### Links in End Matter\n\nSome book retailers get salty if you include end-matter links that go to other retailers. While I understand this, to a degree, I wasn't going to build a separate edition of each e-book for each retailer as at a certain point that becomes stupidly complicated.\n\nWe use generic \"Collection\" pages for each series with a simple forwarding URL like:\n\n`` www.cheribaker.com/Ellie ``\n\nThus readers are redirected to a \"series landing page\" that I control, and when they click a book cover, they can find the whole list of retailer links for that book, including the \"add to cart\" button for purchasing from me.\n\n#### RSS on Shopify\n\nShopify allows you to set up one or more \"blogs\" on your website, and I've set up two, one for essays and one for travel writing, although they are less blogs than they are places for me to store longer-form pieces to share within my newsletter.\n\nI had a hard time finding the RSS feeds. The current correct format is:\n\n`` http://your-website.com/blogs/blog-name.atom ``\n\nI don't see any blog export feature on Shopify, so it's important to keep complete copies of your posts, images, and URLs offline in case you need to regenerate your blog and links on another service in the future.\n\n#### Cookies and Privacy\n\nShopify comes loaded with default settings that probably increase sales, but which I personally don't approve of. Things like tracking cookies and emails to people to remind them to finish their 'abandoned cart.'' Also, they offer a 'pay in installments' option for financing.  I turned off as much of this stuff as I was able to, but the site is still a bit nosier than I'd prefer. \n\n#### International Pricing\n\nShopify will auto-convert US prices for the market currencies we support. However, there are limitiations. The standard version of Shopify doesn't support custom international prices, so I can neither \"round up/down\" to the nearest .49 or .99, nor can I adjust international prices to be a better match for cost-of-living parity.\n\nUnless you spend a LOT of money for the super fancy version of Shopify, you're stuck with their standard conversion, and no customization.\n\n#### Reviews/Social Proof\n\nIt's possible to set up reviews for products in your store. To be frank, book reviews I saw on other author stores read like cherry-picked reviews from their friends and biggest supporters, and I didn't want the headache of dealing with review moderation on my site. For now, I've elected not to bother soliciting reviews on my own site.\n\n## Stuff for the Future\n\nWe're looking into selling audiobooks and paperback books through our store. Lulu offers paperback drop-ship integration, and Bookfunnel would work for audiobook delivery. Before we add more complexity, we want to get a handle on our new e-book store and learn how to sell books there.\n\nTo my fellow booksellers, I hope this helps! Cheers.","lastmodified":"2023-06-28T13:31:53.466756311Z","tags":["projects"]},"/notes/hostile-takeover":{"title":"Writing Hostile Takeover","content":"\n\u003e[!Warning]+Notice\n\u003e\n\u003e Spoilers are possible.

I didn‚Äôt love it as much as I did _The Outsider_, and it got a bit ‚Äúexplainy‚Äù in the third act (crime novels are tough planes to land), but King‚Äôs talent for characterization and description always thrill me. Some have complained that the book is a slow burn, but when aren‚Äôt his books a slow burn? He lets the pot simmer for a long time before the shit _really_ hits the fan, and personally, I love it.\n\n**Skip** Billy Summers if you avoid stories that include sexual assault.\n\n**Read** Billy Summers if you like relatable antiheroes, or Stephen King books in general.\n\n## Thinking about Voice \u0026 POV\n\nLately, I‚Äôve been thinking about _authorial voice_. Namely, how to develop one, or how to bring it out more strongly.\n\nIn first-person narrative, I have an authorial voice. It‚Äôs not _quite_ the same as my blogging voice. Then again, I‚Äôve only written one series in first person, and it includes the first book I ever wrote, so Kat‚Äôs voice has similarities to my own.\n\nIn third-person stories, I haven‚Äôt found my voice yet. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I can string a paragraph together and my characters are distinct people. But that‚Äôs all different than having an authorial voice. Despite writing a bunch of third person stories, I still struggle with letting my tone and style flow through into third person.\n\nFor my last few books, I‚Äôve been working to improve my deep perspective. That means taking the third-person POV camera off the character‚Äôs shoulder and shoving it deep inside their skulls, behind their eyes. It‚Äôs an important skill to have.\n\nBut what if I need my ‚Äúcamera‚Äù to be more mobile than that?\n\nTo describe what I mean, let‚Äôs start with a sentence of inside-the-skull POV (third-person limited) from Billy Summers:\n\n\u003e She stops again and wipes her eyes with the sleeve of her jacket. It‚Äôs cold out here. But the stillness is exquisite. This early even the crows are asleep.\n\nNow, here‚Äôs a sentence of third-person narration from Nora Roberts' Hideaway:\n\n\u003e When Liam Sullivan died, at the age of ninety-two, in his sleep, in his won bed with his wife of sixty-five years beside him, the world mourned.\n\nNote how the camera is more distant. It‚Äôs almost omniscient! And here‚Äôs that same narrator (I think) describing the perspective of a specific character:\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúHow many stories do I have to hear about the great Liam Sullivan?‚Äù\n\u003e \n\u003e Once he‚Äôd thought she understood his thick braided family ties, then he‚Äôd hoped she‚Äôd come to understand them. Now they both understood she just tolerated them.\n\nRoberts' first sentence comes from an introductory section where the family history is described. It‚Äôs disconnected from any particular scene. But that same _not-quite-in-the-skull_ narrator picks up and narrates the POV from the rest of the characters in the story. The narrator is head-hopping, you might say, diving in from skull to skull. Nora does it well, so I can tell which thoughts belong to which person.\n\n**I wonder, is ‚Äúvoice‚Äù expressed through character POV, or does it happen via the narrator‚Äôs voice? I suspect it‚Äôs both.**\n\nCheck out this bit of narration from Billy Summers:\n\n\u003e The living room is as long as a Pullman car. There are three chandeliers, two small and one big. The furniture is low and swoopy. ‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs a grandfather clock that looks embarrassed to be here.\n\u003e \n\u003e Frank Macintosh, the leg-breaker turned manservant, brings them drinks on a tray.\n\nI wonder: who are these observations coming from? Are they Billy‚Äôs observations, or King‚Äôs? It feels blurry to me, but I don‚Äôt much care, because I‚Äôm having fun. But let‚Äôs drop down a paragraph or two:\n\n\u003e He reaches into the pocket of his suitcoat ‚Äì enough fabric there to clothe an orphanage, Billy thinks ‚Äì and produces a wallet.\n\nOkay! Here we‚Äôve got the _Billy thinks_ tag, making it clear that the observation came from him, not the narrator.\n\nThe role of the narrator seems important. But narration is such a slippery concept in third-person perspective. Hmm‚Ä¶ Is good third-person actually an omniscient narrator who keeps her mouth shut a lot?\n\nI don‚Äôt know, but I‚Äôll keep on reading and thinking until I figure it out.","lastmodified":"2023-06-28T13:31:53.470756332Z","tags":["stephen king","book notes","voice"]},"/notes/notes-killing-floor":{"title":"The Killing Floor","content":"\nThe Killing Floor is the first entry in the bestselling Jack Reacher thriller series. I recently gave it a go, curious to see what makes audiences love it.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was the practicality of Child‚Äôs prose. He gets right down to business.\n\n\u003e I WAS ARRESTED IN ENO‚ÄôS DINER. AT TWELVE O‚ÄôCLOCK. I was eating eggs and drinking coffee. A late breakfast, not lunch. I was wet and tired after a long walk in heavy rain. All the way from the highway to the edge of town. The diner was small, but bright and clean. Brand-new, built to resemble a converted railroad car. Narrow, with a long lunch counter on one side and a kitchen bumped out back. Booths lining the opposite wall. A doorway where the center booth would be.\n\nChild uses ‚Äútelling details‚Äù to good effect.\n\n\u003e I HEARD RAISED VOICES IN THE ROSEWOOD OFFICE IN BACK. **The tenor of argument. The slap of a palm on a desk.** The door opened and Stevenson walked out with Chief Morrison. Stevenson looked mad. He strode down the side of the open area. **His neck was rigid with fury.**\n\nThere were so many short sentences! Pages and pages of them. After a while, it felt like being hammered.\n\n\u003e Finlay was at the desk. The tape recorder was there. The stiff cords trailed. The air was still and cool. Finlay looked harassed. His tie was pulled down.\n\nOccasionally, the description becomes less clinical, and that provided some relief.\n\n\u003e We stepped in through the out door. The foul odor of prison hit me. The night exhalation of countless dispirited men. It was nearly pitch black. A night-light glowed dimly. I sensed rather than saw rows of cells. I heard the babble of night sounds. Breathing and snoring. Muttering and whimpering.\n\nReacher fits a certain archetype: the rugged individualist, a man capable of killing with great skill, and who has total independence. He is frustrated with the government, rootless, cynical, and smarter than almost everyone around him.\n\n\u003e I told him no, I enjoyed it. I told him I appreciated the solitude, the anonymity. Like I was invisible. ‚ÄúHow do you mean, invisible?‚Äù he said. He seemed interested. ‚ÄúI travel by road,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAlways by road. Walk a bit, and ride the buses. Sometimes trains. Always pay cash. That way there‚Äôs never a paper trail. No credit card transactions, no passenger manifests, nothing. Nobody could trace me. I never tell anybody my name.\n\nI put the book down at the 1/3rd mark and read the plot summary on Wikipedia.\n\n### Notes to Self\n\nThe sheer volume of description and simple sentences made this a monotonous read for me. The pace felt super slow, I never connected with the protagonist (if anything, I disliked him) and the extreme descriptions of violence squicked me out. I‚Äôm not opposed to violence in stories, but the sexual assault descriptions were enough to put me off this series forever. There are certain types of imagery I‚Äôd rather not have in my head.\n\nIt‚Äôs fair to say that Jack Reacher falls into the ‚Äúnot for me‚Äù category. üôÇ\n\nAt the same time, I think Child‚Äôs use of ‚Äútelling details‚Äù is worth emulating. Sentence fragments and short, simple descriptors can be nice and punchy when setting a scene.","lastmodified":"2023-06-28T13:31:53.470756332Z","tags":["book notes","description","lee child"]},"/notes/notes-last-wish":{"title":"The Last Wish","content":"\n\n\nI first learned about [The Last Wish](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/series/the-witcher/) by watching the Netflix television adaptation. At the time, I knew that _The Witcher_ was a popular video game, although I‚Äôd never played it. When reading about the television show, I learned the games and television show were based on a popular series of fantasy novels by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski. If you have time, you should read the interview with Sapkowski I linked below, because he is every bit as gruff and honest as you‚Äôd expect the creator of Geralt of Rivia to be. üôÇ\n\n_The Last Wish_ is the first book in the Witcher series. It‚Äôs a short story collection about Geralt of Rivia, the titular, monster-hunting hero of the series.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was Sapkowski‚Äôs talent for description:\n\n\n\u003e The smile‚Äîif it had been a smile‚Äîvanished from her face as though wiped away with a cloth.\n  \n\n\u003e Civril stopped laughing. Immediately. Geralt wasn‚Äôt surprised. There was something very strange in Renfri‚Äôs voice‚Äîsomething associated with the red reflection of fire on blades, the wailing of people being murdered, the whinnying of horses and the smell of blood. Others must also have had similar associations‚Äîeven Tavik‚Äôs weather-beaten face grew pale.\n\n  \nGeralt doesn‚Äôt hold back on sharing his philosophy about the world. His grim brand of pragmatism is a reflection of his dual nature. Part monster, part man, Geralt is cynical yet he chooses to protect others.\n\n\n\u003e ‚ÄúEvil is evil, Stregobor,‚Äù said the witcher seriously as he got up. ‚ÄúLesser, greater, middling, it‚Äôs all the same. Proportions are negotiated, boundaries blurred. I‚Äôm not a pious hermit. I haven‚Äôt done only good in my life. But if I‚Äôm to choose between one evil and another, then I prefer not to choose at all.\n\n  \n\u003e ‚ÄúPeople‚Äù‚ÄîGeralt turned his head‚Äî‚Äúlike to invent monsters and monstrosities. Then they seem less monstrous themselves. When they get blind-drunk, cheat, steal, beat their wives, starve an old woman, when they kill a trapped fox with an axe or riddle the last existing unicorn with arrows, they like to think that the Bane entering cottages at daybreak is more monstrous than they are. They feel better then. They find it easier to live.‚Äù\n\n  \nThe narrative voice is strong here, in part because it has interesting things to say. Also, I love how Sapkowski uses punctuation. The em dashes around the gesture of turning his head are not at all typical, but there‚Äôs an immediacy and sense of movement there. The long sentence that follows (When they get blind-drunk‚Ä¶) has a propulsive feel to it. There‚Äôs a _lot_ of technique at work in his prose, but the reader doesn‚Äôt have to work hard to enjoy it. For us, it‚Äôs easy; we can enjoy the ride.\n\nThere‚Äôs a boldness in Geralt‚Äôs voice, a _take-no-prisoners_ and _give-no-fucks_ attitude which manages to be refreshing without being overly acerbic, perhaps because Sapkowsk surrounds that voice with vivid examples and descriptive color. All these factors combined make his prose a pleasure to read.\n\n**My Takeaway (Things to Try)**: Experiment with punctuation and movement within the structure of a paragraph.\n\n## Additional Reading\n\n[An Interview with the Author](https://gizmodo.com/i-do-not-like-working-too-hard-or-too-long-a-refreshin-1841209529)","lastmodified":"2023-06-28T13:31:53.470756332Z","tags":["fantasy","book notes","voice","description"]},"/notes/offline":{"title":"Working and Living Offline","content":"\nI prefer to live and work offline as much as possible. The internet is a life-enhancing utility, much like hot and cold running water, but I like to turn the tap off when I'm not actively using it.\n\nWhy? I value my privacy, my autonomy, and my peace of mind. And I find it easier to connect with the flesh-and-blood world when I'm unplugged from the data-surveillance industrial complex that is the modern internet.\n\nPerhaps that makes me weird? If so, I can live with that. Keep in mind that this isn't advice. I'm simply sharing notes on what I like to do.\n\nThis page describes how I \"turn off the tap\" when I'm not actively internetting.\n\n## Turning my Smartphone into a Dumbphone\n\nI've spent a lot of time researching options for giving up my iPhone. There's a lot that I dislike about my iPhone, and I won't enumerate the reasons here. Unfortunately, there are too many moments where a smartphone is necessary to move through our world with ease.\n\nMy compromise is to keep using a smartphone, but to make my iPhone as dumb as possible.\n\n**My Fix:** I set up a shortcut button that turns off my iPhone's bluetooth, wifi, and cellular data. It also changes my color scheme to black and white. This is my \"dumbphone mode\" and it only allows me to receive cellular phone calls and SMS messages.\n\n*Most of the time, I leave my phone in \"dumbphone\" mode. But if I want to \"internet\" I'll flip my internet on, take care of the task, and flip it off.*\n\n**Why I Bother:** Smartphone apps load data in the background, send telemetry to Apple and other service providers, log your location, habits, and proximity to other devices, and so on. It's possible to toggle some of these things on and off, but I find it simpler to make my phone super dumb and only flip it on when I need something.\n\nMy family and close friends can reach me via SMS or cell at any time, and that's important to me.\n\n## Working Offline\n\nWhile I trust my laptop far more than I trust my phone (hooray for Linux), the internet can be a distraction while I'm working so I generally leave my laptop offline.\n\nWriting fiction requires me to look things up as I work. Sometimes that means checking the spelling of a hyphenated word, and other times it might involve looking up different types of carnivorous plants, or the length of a day on Mars.\n\nI'll flip on my internet if I really have to, but I prefer to keep most of my research materials offline. Here's what I keep at my desk and on my computer:\n\n**Reference Guides**\n- Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary\n- Oxford American Writer's Thesaurus\n- The Chicago Manual of Style\n\nDepending upon what I'm writing, I may have others. Such as the (index of poisons). On the whole, I find physical reference books to be a pleasure to use, and far better organized than most information on the internet.\n\n**Digital Databases**\n* Using a neat piece of software called Kiwix, I have a fully offline, searchable version of Wikipedia on my computer. It's super handy!\n\n**My Own Notes**\n- I keep my personal notes in markdown format, a kind of basic text file. My notes include my journals, to-do lists, and lots of other things grouped by topic. Basically, if something isn't a manuscript file, it goes into a markdown file on my computer, because text files are fast and searchable.\n\nUsing these things, I rarely need to get online while I'm working. Although I do pop online once or twice a day to sync my files, check my email, and enjoy some chitchat.","lastmodified":"2023-06-28T13:31:53.470756332Z","tags":["writing","productivity"]},"/notes/packing":{"title":"packing","content":"# Packing \u0026 Preparing For a Long Trip\n\nPacking for trips that last 1-6 months.\n\n## Gear\n\n **I carry a Farpoint 40L Travel Backpack plus a large purse.**\n\nWhy a backpack?\n- It's big enough for a week's worth of clothes, but small enough to be carried on most flights.\n- I can carry my gear for miles over uneven terrain (curbs, stairs, etc)\n\nWhy a large purse?\n- I can carry my laptop, wallet, and medication on my person when my backpack is out of reach.\n- It doubles as a laptop bag day-to-day.\n- Tip: Make sure your large purse has a zipper *all the way across* so your shit doesn't fall out when your bag is shoved under an airplane seat.\n\nNormally, I don't like large purses, but this setup works best for me on the road.\n\n\n## Packing\n\n* I try to *underpack*, bringing less than I'll need.\n* I prioritize things that are difficult or expensive to buy. Usually that means a couple pairs of pants that fit my short legs, a packable coat and a packable raincoat, a wool sweater, and a few well-fitting bras. On top of that, I throw in some socks, underwear, shirts, one non-wrinkling dress nice enough for dinner out, and a pair of flats. Plus my toiletry kit and a first aid kit.\n* There are three keys to traveling light:\n\t* Plan to do laundry.\n\t* Plan to buy a few items while you travel.\n\t* Bring clothes that color-coordinate so you can layer up or down based on the temperature.\n* Liquids are a hassle when you travel carry-on. I limit myself to one tiny bag with:\n\t* a mini toothpaste\n\t* a mini hand sanitizer\n\t* my favorite moisturizer (hard to find overseas)\n* When we land in a new place, we drop off our gear, sleep, eat, and hit up a grocery store. We pick up toiletries, including toothpaste, shampoo, and so on. Even if you have extra left over when you leave, it's better than the hassle of dealing with liquids in a carry on.\n* If you travel with medication, **check on your supply at least a month before you leave**. You may need to request extra from your doctor.\n\n## Electronics and Communications\n\n**Cell Phone**\n\n* My US cell phone plan *can* be used in other countries, but it's expensive, so I don't use it unless there's an emergency.\n* I purchase an E-SIM plan from [Ubigi](https://www.ubigi.com/) (there are other providers) and add an \"extra\" cell phone data plan to my phone for as long as we're away. Last time, I paid about $10/mo for cellular data in Spain.\n* I upgraded my iPhone SE to one that has E-SIM capability for this purpose.\n* Note: Having a Sim+E-SIM is handy because both lines can be active simultaneously. My regular line is running in case we get a call from a relative, but all my data goes through the much cheaper Ubigi plan.\n\n**Plugs**\n\n* I carry a universal plug adapter like [this one](https://www.amazon.com/EPICKA-Universal-Travel-Adapter-Power/dp/B078S3M2NX). It's a bit bulky, but having all the plugs in one unit is nice if you don't want to be hunting for a new converter when you go someplace unexpected.\n\n\n## Communicating in a Foreign Language\n\n**Phrasebooks**\n\n* I like to travel with a phrase book from either Rick Steves or Lonely Planet. They're small, they work without internet, and they help you pronounce things correctly. Also, slap one on the restaurant table and the servers will know you're a tourist.\n\n**Apps**\n\n* I download Google Translate onto my phone, including the offline language pack for wherever I'll be. You can use your camera to live-translate text, which is helpful when you're making sense of signs and don't want to type everything in.\n\n\n## Preparing to Enter Another Country\n\n**Safety**\n\n* Always check the State Department website (Americans) for rules, warnings, and concerns about where you're visiting. Conditions change. Instead of thinking about \"safe\" and \"unsafe\" countries, recognize that *any* country can go through tumultuous times. It's up to you to be aware.\n* Register for the State Department's Safe Traveler Program.\n* Memorize the country's emergency telephone number (Usually it's not 911) and consider putting it into your phone along with the number of your country's embassy.\n\n**Border Control**\n* Likewise, check your country's embassy website. Make sure you understand the rules of entering the country. Do you need a Visa? How long can you stay? Many countries want proof of your exit ticket, and information about where you'll be staying. Be prepared to follow the rules, although many times you'll be waved through without questions.\n\n\n## Preparing Your Home to be Empty\n\n**Basics**\n* Make care arrangements for your pets well in advance.\n* Throw out all perishable food and *clean your house*. \n* Turn off any recurring subscriptions you don't need, especially things with physical delivery like newspapers that might tip a thief off that you're not home.\n* Unplug appliances (probably not your fridge), turn off valves for gas fireplaces and water taps.\n* Avoid announcing to the world that your home will be empty.\n* Arrange to have your mail stopped, forwarded, or picked up by a friend.\n* Consider putting a light on a timer to deter thieves, or set up a webcam for in-home monitoring.\n* Figure out how you'll pay your bills while you're away.\n\n## Money\n\n**Be Prepared**\n* Always carry multiple payment methods in case one doesn't work while you're gone. Yes, two ATM cards and two credit cards.\n* Check your cards and accounts for foreign transaction fees and foreign ATM fees. Some are minor and others are offensively bad. Always keep some local currency on you, as many places don't accept cards.\n* If possible, leave a set of payment cards in a safe at your hotel. Use one, keep one in reserve.\n* Call your bank and let them know you'll be traveling overseas so they don't think your transactions are fraud.\n* Use regular ATMs to get cash when you land, but be cautious of ATMs at airports and train stations, as many of them have ridiculous fees.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-28T13:31:53.470756332Z","tags":[]},"/notes/paper-horse":{"title":"Writing The Case of the Paper Horse","content":"\n\n| Date     | Wordcount | Notes                                            |\n|:-------- | ---------:|:------------------------------------------------ |\n| 06/27/23 |         0 | [Ready to Begin!](/notes/paper-horse-6-27-23.md) |\n| 06/28/23 |           | [Get the Kettle Boiling](notes/paper-horse-6-28-23.md)                                        |\n\n\n\n\u003e[!Warning]+Notice\n\u003e\n\u003e Spoilers are possible.

So here I am, awake obscenely early, jotting down my thoughts about getting started.\n\nThe Case of the Paper Horse will be the seventh book in the Ellie Tappet Mysteries, and I ended book six on a quintessential happy ending. I‚Äôm not going to blow up Ellie‚Äôs happy ending. She earned it and it‚Äôs hers! But this new book does feel different in that 1-6 comprised the story arc of Ellie finding happiness and now I‚Äôm in more of a one-off ‚Äòmystery of the week‚Äô scenario.\n\nThis morning is about putting myself back into Ellie‚Äôs shoes. A like to start a cozy mystery with an ‚Äúitchy status quo‚Äù where my sleuth has something personal bugging them - the essence of whatever their ‚Äúpersonal thing to overcome‚Äù will be. In this case it‚Äôs easy. Ellie has a new job aboard the ship. She‚Äôs the new boss, and she‚Äôs not very boss-like, so that's bound to be stressful.\n\nAlso, she's back from her honeymoon and living with Ben for the first time. I don‚Äôt anticipate a ton of friction there, but that could also be an adjustment for her.\n\nAt the start of a mystery I like to take the ‚Äúitchy status quo‚Äù and slam it headfirst into some new situation. In this case, it will be planning a ‚Äúmurder mystery cruise‚Äù during a transatlantic repositioning voyage. And to make things extra stressful for poor Ellie I‚Äôll be inviting a formidable travel writer from a famous magazine on board to watch her every move. But that's all setup:\n\n* A new job.\n* A new itinerary.\n* Being the boss for the first time.\n* LOTS of pressure!\n\nPLUS the new situation\n\nThe *Adventurous Spirit* is headed to Spain.\n\nand‚Ä¶\n\nThey‚Äôre planning a murder mystery cruise.\n\nThe \"new situation stuff\" is just fun and tropes. Cozies are supposed to be fun! I‚Äôve always wanted to take a repositioning cruise and a murder mystery party on board feels amusingly meta. Also, I love Spain, and I want to leave the door open for the next book to take place in Valencia. So that‚Äôs where the ship is headed.\n\n## Is this Pantsing?\n\nI'm a happier writer since leaving structured outlines behind. But I‚Äôve had about a year to think about this book, and that's been enough time to jot down some general ideas about the setup, the crime, and whodunnit and why. None of that is set in stone, but I like to have a set of ideas to work with.\n\nStill, there‚Äôs nothing so intimidating as starting the day‚Äôs work with a blank-ass page, so last night I grabbed a notebook and jotted down bullet points for the first couple scenes.\n\nSo this is my work for day one. Get the kettle boiling. Establish the itchy status quo. Smash it into a fun premise. Settle behind Ellie‚Äôs eyes and see it play out as she would.\n\n**Oh, and try not to freak out and overthink things.** ","lastmodified":"2023-06-28T13:31:53.470756332Z","tags":["projects"]},"/notes/places":{"title":"Places I've Been","content":"\n### Countries\n\n- United States (home country)\n- Canada\n- Mexico \n- U.S. Virgin Islands\n- Colombia\n- Peru\n- Chile\n- Equador\n- Japan\n- France\n- Italy\n- Germany\n- Greece\n- Spain\n- Netherlands\n- United Kingdom\n\t- England\n\t- Scotland\n\t- Northern Ireland\n- Ireland\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-28T13:31:53.470756332Z","tags":["travel"]},"/notes/prep-a-novel":{"title":"Preparing to Write a Novel, Step by Step","content":"\n*I originally wrote these posts for Nanowrimo 2019.*\n\n## Let's Half-Ass Nanowrimo Together\n\nHappy October!\n\nIf you‚Äôre a writer, or if you‚Äôd like to be, you‚Äôre¬† hereby invited to half-ass National Novel Writing Month with me. Nanowrimo is an annual event where writers all over the world attempt to finish a novel (or 50,000 words) in the month of November. It‚Äôs a fun time to work on a writing project because there are several thousand other people working towards the same goal.\n\nI‚Äôve never officially ‚Äúwon‚Äù Nano, but it‚Äôs fun to participate, and most of my Nano projects were completed and published after the fact. The only problem with Nanowrimo (in my opinion) is that the standard goal of 50k words in 30 days isn‚Äôt practical for most people- especially those with full-time jobs, family obligations, and the all the writers who feel creatively blocked under rising pressure. Falling behind on your word count is super discouraging if you believe the 50,000 word number is all that matters, and it sucks when new writers feel discouraged for no good reason.\n\nMy solution? Let‚Äôs half-ass Nanowrimo! We can set our own goals, have fun, participate, and hold the whole thing lightly.\n\nI think I‚Äôll write my second cruise ship mystery in November. I estimate it will be a 40,000 word project, but in the end it will be as long as it needs to be. And for the rest of October I‚Äôll send out a short blog post each week about preparing for Nanowrimo. If you want to, you‚Äôre welcome to follow along. Then in November we‚Äôll be ready to half-ass our dreams.\n\nWhen it comes to the arts, there‚Äôs this really tricky line between taking your art seriously and being so regimented that you smother the joy right out of it. The former is good, and the latter is bad, but too often they feel like the same thing. My hope for this Nanowrimo is that we can give ourselves permission to take our writing aspirations seriously without smothering the flame under too many expectations.\n\nSo consider yourself invited. ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\n## Step One: The Idea\n\nHappy Friday! Today‚Äôs post is about preparing for [National Novel Writing Month](https://nanowrimo.org/) . Our first step in preparation is to come up with an idea for the story. Your idea doesn‚Äôt have to be detailed at this point, but it does help to have a basic notion of what your story will be about.\n\n**Choosing a Story Idea**\n\nHow do you know you‚Äôve got a good story idea? Well, it‚Äôs less about originality than it is about the way it makes you feel. The truth is, there are a zillion different stories you might write, and very few stories are based on an original concept. Two authors could choose an identical idea, but in the process of writing, their books would differ because their life experiences, preferences, and inner voice are all different. **The trick to picking a good story idea is finding one that makes you feel excited and curious.** You‚Äôll be spending lots of time on your story, so you want it to be the kind of story that will continue to draw you in.\n\nHere are a handful of story ideas that I pulled out of my brain:\n\n_Halfway into a three-year journey, the leader of a colony ship discovers the planet they‚Äôre headed toward has been destroyed. In fact, several planets have disappeared off the charts over the last twelve months. And whatever is taking out planets is moving slowly toward Earth. Unfortunately, this colony ship is full of criminals, and the Earth Defense Forces will blow them out of the sky if they dare to turn back‚Ä¶_\n\n_A teenage girl falls in love with her best friend‚Äôs boyfriend, and he with her. But her best friend is very sick with a terminal disease, and the love besotted teens are determined to give their sick friend the best senior year possible._\n\n_Take the basic story from Romeo and Juliet and write it from the perspective of an envious servant who deviously pushes the pair toward suicide while making them think it was their own idea. But they fake their deaths as a way of catching her in the act, and the servant goes to prison. Then the Romeo and Juliet characters live happily ever after._\n\n_Tell a poltergeist story but it‚Äôs a coffee roasting facility that‚Äôs haunted and all the beans that go out are cursed. Whenever someone drinks coffee made from the cursed beans they make bad choices that echo the terrible crimes committed in the coffee roasting facility many years prior._\n\nI jotted down those ideas above at random. But the first story idea on my list is probably the best one. Why? Because it invokes my curiosity. Who are these criminals? Where were they headed? What is destroying planets? What will they decide to do? Any idea that opens a lot of doors is usually a fun one to write about. But all those ideas above are workable. Because I‚Äôm continuing an existing series, I did the brainstorming process with my current heroine, and came up with an idea for her next mystery: _The Case of the Karaoke Killer_.¬† That‚Äôll be my book for November, unless I change my mind between now and then.\n\nSo if you‚Äôre half-assing Nano with me, I suggest you spend time this week writing out story ideas. Cast a wide net! Make a list of five or ten ideas, then pick one that you‚Äôll enjoy spending time with.\n\nIf you‚Äôre feeling stuck, you could do worse than to put a new twist on a story you already know and love. Want to write a story that‚Äôs like _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ IN SPACE? Or how about some _Game of Thrones_-style political intrigue but with cyberpunk war machines instead of dragons? Mixing and matching can be a fun way to brainstorm new ideas.\n\nNext week, we‚Äôll take your idea a step further.\n\n## Step Two: Structure\n\nHello, internet buddies! Let‚Äôs continue our NaNoWriMo prep today with this question: _What is a story?_ Well, even if you can‚Äôt verbalize the answer, you know it intuitively because you‚Äôve been hearing stories all your life! Stories are narratives that follow a familiar structure, and coming up with your story structure is your nanowrimo homework of the week.\n\nHere‚Äôs one example of a story structure. This one is called the [Story Circle](https://channel101.fandom.com/wiki/Story_Structure_101:_Super_Basic_Shit)  and it's from television writer Dan Harmon.\n\n**The Story Circle**\n\n**1. Character begins in a zone of comfort.**  \n**2. But they want something.**  \n**3. So they enter an unfamiliar situation.**  \n**4. They adapt to it.**  \n**5. And get what they wanted.**  \n**6. But pay a heavy price.**  \n**7. Then they return to a familiar situation.**  \n**8. Having changed.**\n\nIn my most recent novel, _[The Assistant](https://cheribaker.com/books/the-assistant/)_ , what Jessica Warne wants more than anything is to gain respect, stability, and financial security. She‚Äôs somewhat representative of the Millennial generation, in that she‚Äôs smart and hard working while also being deeply in debt, underutilized, and stuck in a shitty job with few prospects. So when she gets a job offer from a high end staffing firm that offers her huge pay, big challenges, and an all-expenses paid makeover, she‚Äôs over the moon! Finally, she‚Äôs been given the opportunity to prove her skills and become a successful adult. The Duke Agency offers Jessica a path to what she wants, but what will joining the agency cost her? That question is the entry point to the Emerald City Spies series.\n\nIn fact, I wrote one story circle for that series as a whole, and smaller story circles for each novel within the series. The story circles fit together like LEGO blocks, and I find that to be a satisfying way of holding a narrative together.\n\nNot a fan of the story circle? Here‚Äôs another sample story structure that I found online and jotted down a while ago. (I don‚Äôt know who came up with it, but I‚Äôll update this post if I can find the original source.)\n\n**In order to *Avoid Problem* a *Flawed Character* must *Try To Achieve Goal* but when *Complication Arises* they realize they must overcome *Antagonist* and *Personal Flaw* by *Doing Cool Shit* before *Deadline*.**\n\nNice and compact, right? But you can see how all the big elements of the story are contained within that structure. Have you noticed that stories usually contain both an antagonist (external enemy) and a character flaw (internal enemy)? Perfect characters are dull, and stories that moralize about personal growth without real-world consequences are also dull. That‚Äôs why most stories contain both character growth _and_ an external threat of some kind. Those elements work together to create a satisfying story.\n\nFor those who like lots of detail, you can find story spreadsheets on Jami Gold‚Äôs website that contain more detailed templates for story structures. They‚Äôre a great resource, but personally I prefer to keep my structure loose at this stage to give myself lots of room to play as I‚Äôm drafting the story. But feel free to check the worksheets out if the structures I laid out above feel too vague. I‚Äôm also a big fan of Libby Hawker‚Äôs short book on structure: [Take Off Your Pants.](https://www.amazon.com/Take-Off-Your-Pants-Outline-ebook/dp/B00UKC0GHA)\n\nIt might feel too early to outline your book, and that‚Äôs fine. For now, I want you thinking _big picture_. \n\n### Let‚Äôs Get Ready for Nano!\n\nTo recap, here‚Äôs your suggested homework for the week: **Take your story idea from last week and apply some structure to it.** Use big, broad strokes, and think about how your story will flow. Where does your main character begin? What is their goal? What will be their main plan to reach that goal? Where will they fall down? And how will they be changed by the time your reader reaches the final page?\n\nThink it through, and jot down some notes, but don‚Äôt stress if you feel it‚Äôs too early to make these decisions. Some writers like to go into their story completely planless, and you might be one of them. But for me, having a loose structure defined stops me from flailing too much during the first draft, so I encourage you to think those questions through.\n\nNext time, we‚Äôll do some time-saving prep work as we tackle _Characters_, _Point of View_, and _Setting_.\n\n## Step Three: Characters, POV, and Setting\n\nWelcome back to our month-long prep for national novel writing month in which I invite you to half-ass NaNoWriMo with me. In week one we talked about coming up with a story idea , and last week we discussed structure. This week‚Äôs prep covers three more elements of story building: Character, Point of View, and Setting. The prep work we do this week will help us write more quickly when we begin drafting our stories in November.\n\n### Decision 1: Which Point of View Will You Use?\n\nThink of point of view (POV) as the _camera_ you use when telling a story. You might tell your story from inside _one_ character‚Äôs head, using sentences like ‚ÄúI raced down the hall.‚Äù If so, that‚Äôs called first-person perspective. It‚Äôs a fun way to tell a story because the tale unfolds like you are reading someone‚Äôs diary. But there‚Äôs a big limiting factor. You can‚Äôt tell the reader things that your main character doesn‚Äôt know! We can only see what the POV character sees, which is why it‚Äôs a popular choice for murder mysteries.\n\nSo perhaps you‚Äôd like to describe events from outside your main character‚Äôs head? Your sentences will read more like this: ‚ÄúErin raced down the hall.‚Äù This is third-person perspective. We‚Äôre not inside Erin‚Äôs head the whole time, but we‚Äôre able to follow her closely. If we tell the story from Erin‚Äôs perspective, using a third-person POV, that‚Äôs called third-person _limited_. But that‚Äôs not our only option here. If we‚Äôre careful not to confuse our readers, we can also switch our camera between different characters in third-person. We could write one chapter from Erin‚Äôs point of view, then another chapter from her adversary‚Äôs point of view, for example. This is helpful when we‚Äôre following different groups of people, or when we want to build suspense by showing what the bad guys are up to.\n\n_Tip:_ If you‚Äôre using third person to tell the story through the eyes of multiple characters, keep the number of POV characters limited. Juggling a bunch of POV characters is difficult to do, and too many camera angles may alienate readers who get invested in one character only to have you hop into someone else‚Äôs head.\n\nLastly, we have Omniscient point of view. Common in epic fantasy, omniscient POV is where there is a narrator who knows all things, and they are telling us the story. Omniscient point of view pulls the camera way out and provides a panoramic view of events across different groups of people, places, and even different points in time.\n\nA quick note about tense: We also get to choose whether we will write our story in _past tense_ or _present tense_. Present tense is less common, but it‚Äôs become more prevalent in YA novels and some thrillers. Most novels will be written in past tense, telling us what happened, not what is happening. If you‚Äôre curious about what effective present tense looks like, check out The Hunger Games trilogy.\n\nSo your first decision for the week is this: what POV will you write in? If you aren‚Äôt sure, it‚Äôs smart to follow the conventions of your chosen genre. Murder mysteries are all past tense, for example, and can be told in either first person or third. If it helps, pull a few books from your preferred genre off the shelf and flip through the pages. What point of view do they use? Emulating others is a fine place to start.\n\n### Decision 2: Who Are My Characters?\n\nFor each of your primary characters, I‚Äôll suggest that you fill out a quick character sheet that summarizes important facts about them. Here‚Äôs an example of what goes into a character sheet, but you can include any categories you like:\n\n_Name:_  \n_Age:_  \n_Appearance:_  \n_Clothing/Style:_  \n_Mannerisms:_  \n_Family Situation/Important Relationships:_  \n_Education:_  \n_Nationality/Group Membership:_  \n_Positive Traits:_  \n_Quirks:_  \n_Flaws:_  \n_How they Respond to Stress:_  \n_Goals:_\n\n_Tip:_ Don‚Äôt worry if your characters feel ‚Äúflat on the page‚Äù at this point, because if you are anything like me, you‚Äôll get to know your characters as you write them. You‚Äôll be writing a scene and their personalities will come busting out, surprising you. But it definitely helps to have some of the basics ironed out, like names, appearance, and a few personality traits. This will keep your words flowing instead of stopping you up every time you need to come up with a name. This also helps when you need to remember a fact mid-story. Checking a character sheet is easier than paging through a hundred pages of text to make sure you didn‚Äôt change someone‚Äôs name or hair color mid-book.\n\nSome writers also add a stock photo or celebrity photo to their character sheets, ‚Äúcasting the character‚Äù to make it easier to describe them when the moment comes. If that helps you out, go for it! Also, some writers ‚Äúget into the zone‚Äù by doing some freewriting (journaling) from the perspective of their main character. I‚Äôve done that a time or two, but usually I just dive into the story itself and let the characters show up.\n\n_Tip:_ Need help coming up with character names? Check out [this generator](https://blog.reedsy.com/character-name-generator/) and [popular names in the USA by decade.](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/decades/) The latter is helpful when you want to name characters via their age. A 30 year old might be a Jessica, and a 50 year old might be a Heather, for example.\n\n### Decision 3: What are my Major Settings?\n\nLastly, it can help things along during NaNoWriMo if you know what your major settings are. Will your scenes take place in an office? A mall? A spaceship? I like to pull photographs and illustrations of settings I might use off the web and stick them in a research folder. I don‚Äôt spend a lot of time on this, but that way when I want to describe a room or setting I can pull up a photo and use it as a reference. Wikipedia is a good resource for snagging details about different cities.\n\nThat‚Äôs it! This week‚Äôs work will help you hit the ground running once Nano begins. We‚Äôve got two more posts in this Nano prep series. Next week I‚Äôll cover outlining, an optional step, and in our final week we‚Äôll discuss workspace, time management, and mindset.\n\n\n## Step Four: Beat Sheets\nWelcome back to my Preparing for Nanowrimo series! We‚Äôre just a few weeks away now and _shit‚Äôs about to get real_. But no worries! If you‚Äôve been prepping along with me you have your story idea plus a bit of structure, also known as your story arc. Perhaps you‚Äôve jotted down some notes about your characters and chosen a point of view to write from. If so, you‚Äôre already well ahead of the game. For me, this stage in the writing process feels exciting but messy. Today we‚Äôll add some specificity to our writing plan to help us hit the ground running on November 1st.\n\nThis week I recommend you create something called a **beat sheet** for your story. A beat sheet is a bullet point list of the major events in your story. I used to call this step _outlining_, but in all honesty I hate the concept of outlining because it feels too rigid. So I think of my beat sheet as _pre-writing_. I‚Äôm smoothing the path by laying down some ideas I can expand upon.\n\nA story ‚Äúbeat‚Äù is a small piece of action that moves your story forward. Think of it like a note of music, leading to another note, and another.\n\nHere‚Äôs a sample of two beats from a cruise ship mystery I just drafted: _The Case of the Missing Finger_\n\n\u003e DAY ONE: MID-DAY BOARDING ‚Äì SUNDAY ‚Äì MIAMI\n\u003e \n\u003e -   Ellie admires the cruise ship. The S/V Adventurous Spirit is far bigger than she‚Äôd imagined and she compares it against what she read in the brochure two years prior. It‚Äôs very white and has tropical birds painted on the hull. She wishes Ronnie were there with her, but reminds herself that he wouldn‚Äôt want her feeling sorry for herself.\n\u003e -   Her daughter in law comes up beside her, making noise. She loves her DIL, but her concern-trolling is a bit much. Does Ellie have X, does she have Y? DIL _hates_ the thought of Ellie being alone on the ship. It‚Äôs too bad she couldn‚Äôt wait for all of them to go. Ellie remarks that she won‚Äôt be alone, she has 1,XXX new friends. She says this, but inside she‚Äôs feeling nervous. Mostly she sees couples and families. Was taking this cruise alone a mistake? She hopes she won‚Äôt be lonely. But it can‚Äôt be worse than moping around at home. She‚Äôs tired of feeling sad.\n\nEarlier, when we talked about structure , I mentioned that your character will likely start out in a zone of comfort (or a status quo) but they _want_ something. My opening beats establish who Ellie is, what she wants, and what she‚Äôs leaving behind. Over the early chapters we learn that she‚Äôs widowed and that she loves her family, but she‚Äôs also craving more adventure in her life. From there I move into the plot of the murder mystery.\n\nYour ‚Äúbeats‚Äù might be a single sentence, a paragraph, or something longer. It‚Äôs up to you! What we‚Äôre doing here is taking our prior prep work (structure, character, setting) and fluffing them out into a list of events.\n\n_Tip:_ I‚Äôve _never_ been able to define the final few beats of my story. I leave those blank, because I know I won‚Äôt know what the final scenes look like until I arrive there. So don‚Äôt worry if that happens to you too. This isn‚Äôt a school assignment and you aren‚Äôt being graded. Do it your own way.\n\n### Tips for Building Your Beat Sheet\n\nBeat sheets are optional. You might prefer to sit down without one and just crank the words. But I find having a beat sheet helpful because I can take a beat and paste it into a document for the day, then expand it out to a full scene. This is far easier (for me) than generating every single scene on the fly.\n\nHere are some things that might happen when you try to make a beat sheet:\n\n1.  You write some beats, then you read them, then you think BOY THIS IS BORING. That‚Äôs helpful! It‚Äôs your signal to come up with some exciting events to spice up your story.\n    \n2.  You write five or ten beats, then you‚Äôre not sure what happens next. That‚Äôs fine! You might come back tomorrow with more ideas, or you might want to start with those initial ideas and take it from there. There‚Äôs no wrong way to do this.\n    \n3.  You make a beat-sheet for your full novel, but it seems a bit sparse in sections. No biggie! You‚Äôll find yourself adding more depth and detail in the moment as you write. Some of us write ‚Äúthin‚Äù beat sheets then thicken up the story considerably as we write.\n    \n4.  You make a beat sheet and use it, but then you find your story is diverting off the path you set. That‚Äôs cool! You can adjust your beat sheet as you go, because we don‚Äôt always see the story in full until we start writing it. That‚Äôs normal and pretty darn fun. A surprised writer can mean surprised readers too.\n    \n5.  You start making a beat sheet, but you get all jazzed and some of your ‚Äúbeats‚Äù are getting really long and detailed like scenes. Awesome! You might be doing some early writing before Nano starts, but I‚Äôm not going to rat you out.\n    \n\nFor this week‚Äôs nano prep, my suggestion is that you try to write a beat sheet for your novel, or at least for the first part of your story. Can you make Nanowrimo easier by laying down some beats before you start writing? If so, go for it.\n\nFuture-you might be very glad you did. üôÇ\n\n## Step Five: Mindset\nHey, Nano preppers! We‚Äôre just a few days away from the big event, so I‚Äôll wrap up this Nanowrimo prep series with some tips about mindset. How should we _think_ about our writing? And what attitudes should we adopt in order to complete our projects well? I‚Äôve got a few suggestions, which I‚Äôve listed below in the form of beliefs.¬† Do you agree with these beliefs, and if so, are you ready to adopt them?\n\n### Belief 1: Writing requires time and effort, so I‚Äôve made space in my life to do it.\n\nWriting is work, right? It‚Äôs work in the same way that going to your day job is work. If you put in the time and make an effort, you‚Äôll make it through and you‚Äôll improve your skills over time. And because we learn by writing, not by worrying about our writing, action is what matters.\n\nThat begins by making time, space, and energy available for your November writing project.\n\n### Belief 2: I‚Äôm writing a first draft. Later, I‚Äôll improve it.\n\nWriting a first draft is about telling the story to yourself. You can trust your future-self to edit your story, and focus now on the first task which is getting the whole story down so you can look at it. Nanowrimo isn‚Äôt the time to perfect your ‚Äúfirst page hook‚Äù or obsess about comma placement.\n\nThat being said, you‚Äôre not required to write a shitty first draft!¬† I‚Äôd rather see you produce the best work you can, right now, given your current skill level. Let‚Äôs talk for a moment about the notion of the happy medium, when it comes to the quality of your first draft.\n\n### Finding the Happy Medium\n\n‚Äú_I‚Äôll just write shit because that‚Äôs what a first draft is._‚Äù¬† Nah. Why on Earth would you intentionally write shit?\n\n‚Äú_I won‚Äôt start chapter two until chapter one is AMAZING._‚Äù¬† Nope! You‚Äôre being too rigid. First drafts aren‚Äôt amazing. You‚Äôll be stuck in a perfectionist loop!\n\n‚Äú_I‚Äôll write this scene to the best of my current ability. Then I‚Äôll move on to the next, because this is FIRST DRAFT TIME, baby!_‚Äù¬† Perfect! You‚Äôve found the happy medium.\n\nSeek out that happy medium, okay?\n\n### Belief 3: It‚Äôs time to listen to my gut and heart. Not the experts.\n\nYou‚Äôve probably internalized a lot of advice from other writers, right? Stephen King hates adverbs. Others advise against prologues. Your high school English teacher yelled at you for using sentence fragments, or starting a sentence with _and_. Yadda Yadda_._ Taken in context, writing advice can be useful. But for a beginner, all this advice becomes an extra voice of criticism, making you second-guess your natural style as you start writing.\n\n_Tip:_ You‚Äôre fine. Just write! Use the voice that comes naturally to you. Fix any excesses in editing, and stop worrying about what the experts think. It‚Äôs not their story. It‚Äôs yours!\n\n### Belief 4: Progress matters, but progress is not linear.\n\nYou might have this idealized notion that you‚Äôll write X words per day during Nanowrimo. And goals can be motivating sometimes. But in reality, writing is far more‚Ä¶ lumpy than you might expect. You might have a day where you squeak out 200 words during lunch, and another day when you write four chapters because the words won‚Äôt stop flowing. It‚Äôs okay to have general targets in mind, but don‚Äôt flip out if you‚Äôre not producing equal numbers of words.\n\nKeep it simple. Every time you write, move your story forward. And try to set aside enough hours in the month to reach your overall goal. That‚Äôs really all you can do.\n\n### Belief 5: No one is forcing me to do this.\n\nWrite because you love it. Or because it challenges you. Or because you‚Äôre curious to see if you can. Write because you‚Äôve got a story to tell, or because you‚Äôve admired authors forever and books still feel like magic.\n\nBut if writing is making you miserable, or if you hate it, it‚Äôs okay to stop. Don‚Äôt turn a story into an ego contest with yourself. Remember, no one is forcing you to do it. Proceed with the intention that you‚Äôll enjoy yourself, and see how it goes.\n\n### Belief 6: I‚Äôll decide what to do with this story later.\n\nYou might publish your story, or not. You might give it to friends to read, or not. But my point is, you don‚Äôt need to worry about any of that now. Get the draft down, edit it later, and then you can decide what to do.\n\nYour story is a squalling little baby made of words. It‚Äôs red-faced and shouty and it has no career plans or life goals. So put away the college pamphlets and let it grow up a little. Let your story exist for its own sake! Don‚Äôt squash it under all your bossy expectations.\n\nAnd that leads me to my most important belief, which is this:\n\n### Belief 7: I‚Äôm a writer.\n\nIf you write, you‚Äôre a writer. There‚Äôs no secret-handshake, certification, or permission slip required. Drop the word ‚Äúaspiring‚Äù from your vocabulary and flush your impostor syndrome down the toilet. Once you accept the reality that you‚Äôre a writer, you can stop being all angsty about labels and _do your damn job._\n\nYou can write.\n\nNanowrimo might be the start of something lasting, or perhaps just a fun month to try something new. Either answer is fine, but time spent worrying about labels is wasted time. Imagine me smacking you upside the head with THE OFFICIAL SCEPTER OF ALL WRITERS. Boom. You‚Äôre a writer! Now get to work.\n\nThis concludes my Nanowrimo prep series, and I hope you‚Äôve found it helpful. Good luck with your story, and feel free to drop me a comment during the month of November to tell me how your project is going. And if you‚Äôd like some _in-person_ camaraderie during the month of November, there are plenty of local meetup groups being organized on the official [Nanowrimo](http://www.nanowrimo.org) website right now.\n\nHappy writing!\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-28T13:31:53.470756332Z","tags":["how-to","nanowrimo"]},"/notes/project-mars":{"title":"Writing Outlaw Justice","content":"\n## Book Summary\n\n\u003e[!Warning]+Notice\n\u003e\n\u003e Spoilers are possible.

In giving her a home and a purpose, and in providing her with an outstanding education, Mars fulfilled the promise that the founders had made more than a hundred years before.\n\u003e\n\u003e*Community. Justice. Scientific Exploration.*\n\u003e\n\u003eIn gratitude, Loretta chose a career of public service.

She may not be a skilled pilot, like her friend Kacy, or a successful politician, like her adopted father Cayden, but her talents as a mediator and weapons trainer have earned her a certain respect among her peers. Now, Loretta has set her sight on a new goal, becoming the youngest Arbitrator in Martian history.\n\u003e\n\u003eMars itself is at an inflection point.

Accent work is beyond my skill level, and rather than butchering a dozen lovely accents I've opted to go with my own voice.\n\t* Fix: Include a brief authors note/forward explaining that I will not be doing accents.\n* Audiobook sales are a near-monopoly situation, and there are only a handful of distributors, most of whom have really shitty contract terms. \n\t* Fix: Unknown. (I'm still considering my options)\n\n## My Recording Location\n\nMy tiny urban condo lacks a closet or small room suitable for recording, and cities are noisy, so I use my building's movie room. It has moderate soundproofing and soft walls. Combined with my microphone's isolation shield, it's not bad!\n\n**Audiobook files need to have a noise floor (silence) of -60DB**. When I choose a quiet time of day, I can record at -56DB. That's pretty close, and I can tweak the noise floor a little when I process the files.\n\n## Recording as Proofing \n\nTo streamline my work *I'm combining audio recording with proofreading*. Once a chapter is complete and edited (content edits + line edit) I begin recording.\n\nWhen reading work aloud, proofreading errors stand out clearly. I pause the recording, fix the error in the manuscript file, and re-record that sentence, all on the fly.\n\nUpdate 4/23: This works really well! In my first complete recording of an audiobook I found 10 small errors that had slipped through despite editing and beta reading, across 62,000 words.\n\n## Preparing the Manuscript for Recording\n\n\n\n## Pre-Record Checklist\n\n- Dress in quiet clothing, remove watches, rings, anything that might make noise.\n- Set up the microphone, laptop, and tablet at head level. \n- Bring a big bottle of water.\n- Open manuscript on tablet. Don't TAP the tablet because it will put a thud on the microphone. Slide to advance the text. (SSSHHH!)\n- Plug headphones into the microphone so you hear yourself as you go.\n- Turn off anything you can that makes noise. (HVAC, Phone, Notifications, etc.)\n- Warm up the voice! ([how to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcOF1fH20JM))\n\n## When Starting a New Project\n\n- Record and save 10 seconds of \"room tone\" (silence). You'll need it when adding pauses during editing. Every room's \"silence\" sounds different.\n\n## Useful Commands in Audacity\n\n- SHIFT + R: Record\n- Spacebar: STOP/PLAY\n- SHIFT + D: Punch and Roll\n\n### Punch and Roll\n\n*For backing up and re-starting when you've messed up.*\n\nPlace the marker (line) before your spoken error or flub. Hit SHIFT + D and the previous five seconds will play. You can speak over your own voice to get into the correct rhythm. At the marker, recording will resume. \n\n## Audiobook Plugins for Audacity\n\n[ACX Check](https://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Nyquist_Analyze_Plug-ins#ACX_Check)\n[Loudness Normalization](https://alphamanual.audacityteam.org/man/Loudness_Normalization)\n\n## Audiobook Editing\n\n*coming*\n\n## Mastering the Audio Files\n\n*coming*\n\n## Reference Links\n\n[Audiobook Mastering - Audacity Wiki](https://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Audiobook_Mastering)\n[Preparing an Audiobook File for Recording](https://cchogan.com/audiobook-tips-a-short-guide/preparing-a-script-for-recording/)\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-28T13:31:53.470756332Z","tags":["audiobooks"]},"/notes/shadow-doubt":{"title":"Writing Shadow of a Doubt","content":"\n\u003e[!Warning]+Notice\n\u003e\n\u003e Spoilers are possible.
